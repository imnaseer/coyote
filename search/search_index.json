Monitor states that are marked neither Hot nor Cold are called warm states. First, any terminated execution of the program must not have a monitor in a hot state. Second, the program should not have infinite executions that remain in hot (or warm) states infinitely without transitioning to a cold state. While the former is a safety property and easily checked, the latter requires generation of infinite executions, which is not really possible in practice and we must resort to heuristics. Coyote maintains a temperature for each monitor. The temperature goes up by a unit if the monitor transitions to a hot state, it goes to zero on a transition to a cold state and stays the same on transition to a warm state. The Coyote tester looks for executions where the temperature of a monitor exceeds a particular large threshold because it indicates a long suffix stuck in hot/warm states without transitioning to a cold state. The definition of what is large is where you can help the tester. The tester accepts a flag --max-steps N . Using this flag, you can say that the program is expected to execute around N steps per test iteration. Executions substantially longer than N are treated as potential infinite executions. But what is a step and how does one estimate N? This can be done using a few iterations of the tester. For example, consider the failover coffee machine using actors sample program. Assuming you have built the samples you can test it with the coyote test tool as follows, setting N steps as 200. From the coyote-samples folder: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineActors.dll -i 10 -ms 200 -p 4 --sch-portfolio The coyote test tool will produce output, ending with something like the following: ...

Done Note the line that reads Exceeded the max-steps bound of '200' in 95.00% of the fair schedules . It means that the program execution exceeded 200 steps several times (95% of the times) to reach termination. The line above it indicates that execution lengths ranged from 153 steps to 1066 steps, averaging 457 steps. Going by this output, let\u2019s decide to increase the bound to 1000 and re-run coyote test . coyote test ./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineActors.dll -i 10 -ms 1000 -p 4 --sch-portfolio This time the output will be something like: ...

Done The testing is a little bit slower: taking a bit more than 3 seconds for the same number of iterations. But the tester hit the bound much fewer times, making the testing much more effective as it more often covers the entire length of program execution. In general, it is not necessary to make this percentage go to zero. Often times, programs can exceed their expected length of execution, either because of bugs, or because of corner-case scheduling that delays important events more than usual. You could pick a max-steps bound that is very large. However, this will slow down the tester (when using unfair schedulers; see the next section for details). Thus, it is recommended that you do a few iterations with the tester before settling down on the desired max-steps bound. To understand the details behind fair and unfair scheduling that is mentioned in the output above, let\u2019s move on to next section targeted towards more advanced usage of Coyote. Fair and unfair scheduling See the following technical paper that explains the concept behind fair and unfair scheduling: Fair stateless model checking. Madan Musuvathi and Shaz Qadeer. PLDI 2008. Consider a program with two actors A and B. The actor A continuously sends an event to itself until it receives a message from B. The actor B is ready to send the message to A immediately upon creation. (Contrast this example to Figure 3 of the paper.) This program has an infinite execution: where A is continuously scheduled without giving B a chance. Such an infinite execution is called unfair because B is starved over an infinitely long period of time, which is unrealistic in modern systems. The coyote test tool works by taking over the scheduling of the Coyote program. It uses one of several schedulers : algorithms that decide which actor to schedule next. A scheduler is called fair if it is not expected to generate unfair executions. For example, the random scheduler, which makes decisions on the next actor to schedule randomly, is fair. In the program described above, it is very likely that B will be given a chance to execute. Some schedulers don\u2019t have this property and are called unfair schedulers. Unfair schedulers have a role to play in finding violations of safety properties, but not in finding violations of liveness properties. The pct scheduler of Coyote (enabled with the --sch-pct N option) is unfair. Because of their nature, unfair schedulers are expected to generate longer than usual executions. The unfairness in scheduling can lead to starvation of certain actors, which may stall progress. The expected length of a program\u2019s execution is best determined by looking at lengths of \u201cfair terminating executions\u201d, i.e., executions that terminate under a fair scheduler. For this reason, we provide the fairpct scheduler (enabled with the --sch-fairpct N option) which uses the pct scheduler for a prefix of each execution and then switches to the default fair random scheduler for the remaining of the execution. When a user supplies the flag --max-steps N , executions under an unfair scheduler are forced to stop after N steps. Whereas, an execution under a fair scheduler can go to up 10N steps. Further, if the execution stays in a hot state for more than 5N steps, a liveness bug is flagged. You can additionally supply the flag -max-steps N M to limit fair schedulers to explore only up to M steps (instead of 10N). There are other smarter heuristics available in the tester as well that do away with the need for such bounds by looking for lasso shaped executions. If interested, read more about it in the following paper from Microsoft Research. Lasso Detection using Partial-State Caching. FMCAD 2017. To avoid having to think which scheduler works best for which situation, we recommend running coyote test in parallel (enabled with the -p N option), using the portfolio scheduler (enabled with the --sch-portfolio option) which consists of a carefully tuned selection of fair schedulers (including random and fairpct ).","title":"Effective liveness checking"},{"location":"core/liveness-checking/#effective-liveness-checking","text":"The presence of monitors that have Hot and Cold states implicitly specifies two assertions.

The expected length of a program\u2019s execution is best determined by looking at lengths of \u201cfair terminating executions\u201d, i.e., executions that terminate under a fair scheduler. For this reason, we provide the fairpct scheduler (enabled with the --sch-fairpct N option) which uses the pct scheduler for a prefix of each execution and then switches to the default fair random scheduler for the remaining of the execution. When a user supplies the flag --max-steps N , executions under an unfair scheduler are forced to stop after N steps. Whereas, an execution under a fair scheduler can go to up 10N steps. Further, if the execution stays in a hot state for more than 5N steps, a liveness bug is flagged. You can additionally supply the flag -max-steps N M to limit fair schedulers to explore only up to M steps (instead of 10N). There are other smarter heuristics available in the tester as well that do away with the need for such bounds by looking for lasso shaped executions. If interested, read more about it in the following paper from Microsoft Research. Lasso Detection using Partial-State Caching. FMCAD 2017. To avoid having to think which scheduler works best for which situation, we recommend running coyote test in parallel (enabled with the -p N option), using the portfolio scheduler (enabled with the --sch-portfolio option) which consists of a carefully tuned selection of fair schedulers (including random and fairpct ).","title":"Fair and unfair scheduling"},{"location":"core/logging/","text":"Logging The Coyote runtime provides a Microsoft.Coyote.IO.ILogger interface for logging so that your program output can be captured and included in coyote test tool output logs.

You can provide your own implementation of Microsoft.Coyote.IO.ILogger by setting the Logger property on the ICoyoteRuntime or IActorRuntime . The IActorRuntime also provides a higher level logging interface called IActorRuntimeLog for logging Actor and StateMachine activity. Example of custom ILogger It is possible to replace the default logger with a custom one. The following example captures all log output in a StringBuilder : public class CustomLogger : ILogger { private StringBuilder StringBuilder; public TextWriter TextWriter => throw new NotImplementedException(); public CustomLogger() { this.StringBuilder = new StringBuilder(); } public void Write(string value) { this.Write(LogSeverity.Informational, value); } public void WriteLine(string value) { this.WriteLine(LogSeverity.Informational, value); } public void Write(string format, params object[] args) { this.Write(LogSeverity.Informational, format, args); } public void WriteLine(string format, params object[] args) { this.WriteLine(LogSeverity.Informational, format, args); } public void Write(LogSeverity severity, string format, object[] args) { this.Write(severity, string.Format(format, args)); } public void WriteLine(LogSeverity severity, string format, object[] args) { this.WriteLine(severity, string.Format(format, args)); } public void Write(LogSeverity severity, string value) { switch (severity) { case LogSeverity.Informational: this.StringBuilder.Append(\"<info>\" + value); break; case LogSeverity.Warning: this.StringBuilder.Append(\"<warning>\" + value); break; case LogSeverity.Error: this.StringBuilder.Append(\"<error>\" + value); break; case LogSeverity.Important: this.StringBuilder.Append(\"<important>\" + value); break; } } public void WriteLine(LogSeverity severity, string value) { this.Write(severity, value); this.StringBuilder.AppendLine(); } public override string ToString() { return this.StringBuilder.ToString(); } public void Dispose() { // todo } } To replace the default logger, call the following IActorRuntime method: runtime.Logger = new CustomLogger(); The above method replaces the previously installed logger with the specified one and returns the previously installed logger. Note that the old Logger might be disposable, so if you care about disposing the old logger at the same time you may need to write this instead: using (var oldLogger = runtime.Logger) { runtime.Logger = new CustomLogger(); } You could write a custom ILogger to intercept all logging messages and send them to an Azure Log table, or over a TCP socket. IActorRuntimeLog The default IActorRuntimeLog implementation is the ActorRuntimeLogTextFormatter base class which is responsible for formatting all Actor and StateMachine activity as text and writing that out using the installed Logger . You can add your own implementation of IActorRuntimeLog or ActorRuntimeLogTextFormatter using the RegisterLog method on IActorRuntime . This is additive so you can have the default ActorRuntimeLogTextFormatter and another logger running at the same time. For example, see the ActorRuntimeLogGraphBuilder class which implements IActorRuntimeLog and generates a directed graph representing all activities that happened during the execution of your actors. See activity coverage for an example graph output. The coyote test tool sets this up for you when you specify --graph or --coverage activity command line options. The --verbosity command line option can also affect the default logging behavior. When --verbosity is specified all log output is written to the System.Console by default, but you can specify different levels of output using --verbosity quiet to get no output, --verbosity minimal to see only error messages and --verbosity normal to get errors and warnings. This can produce a lot of output especially if you run many testing iterations. It is usually more useful to only capture the output of the one failing iteration in a log file and this is done automatically by the testing runtime when --verbosity is not specified. See IActorRuntimeLog API documentation . Example of a custom IActorRuntimeLog You can also implement your own IActorRuntimeLog . The following is an example of how to do this: internal class CustomLogWriter : IActorRuntimeLog { // Callbacks on runtime events public void OnCreateActor(ActorId id, ActorId creator) { // Override to change the behavior. } public void OnEnqueueEvent(ActorId id, Event e) { // Override to change the behavior. } // More methods to implement. } You can then register your new implementation using the following IActorRuntime method: runtime.RegisterLog(new CustomLogWriter()); You can register multiple IActorRuntimeLog objects in case you have loggers that are doing very different things. The runtime will invoke each callback for every registered IActorRuntimeLog . Customizing the ActorRuntimeLogTextFormatter You can modify the format of text log messages by providing your own ActorRuntimeLogTextFormatter . You can subclass the default ActorRuntimeLogTextFormatter implementation to override its default behavior.

Intuitively, a program is deterministic whenever it executes in the same manner if provided the same inputs. Most software, however, isn\u2019t deterministic. Let\u2019s begin by understanding this non-determinism and how it makes your life as developers more difficult. The most common form of non-determinism stems from concurrency. Consider the following procedure: // Shared variable x. int x = 0; int foo() { // Concurrent operations on x. var t1 = Task.Run(() => { x = 1; }); var t2 = Task.Run(() => { x = 2; }); // Join all. Task.WaitAll(t1, t2); } Executing foo can result in x == 1 or x == 2 . The exact value of x depends on the order in which the tasks are executed. This is non-determinism because the scheduling of tasks is not in your control. Adding synchronization helps reduce the amount of non-determinism but doesn\u2019t completely take it away. The above example showed a classical data race . Actually, it is a low level data race between individual memory accesses. Even high level races such as the order in which messages arrive and get processed also contributes to non-determinism. Non-determinism arises from many other sources as well. Timeouts are a good example. The use of timers prevail in many distributed systems. Consider a program that wishes to offload some computation to a remote computer. It will typically send a message over the network, and then start a timer with some pre-determined timeout value. If the response arrives successfully from the remote machine, the timer is canceled and all is good. If the timer fires before the response arrives, then the sender may wish to invoke a recovery action. Which of these two cases actually happen in practice is, again, not in the programmer\u2019s control. Timers, thus, are another source of non-determinism in the program. Other similar examples include failures. When designing software services that execute in the cloud, you must anticipate the possibility of hardware or software failures that cause the hosting VM to reboot. In such cases the fallback is to restart the VM (or spawn a new one) to take over the failed process. This is also non-determinism because the failure (and restart) can happen at any time. Calling into an external service that may return one of many error codes is also non-determinism; the exact return value is again not in your control when you call the external service. The trouble with non-determinism is that you must defend against all the ways in which the non-determinism unfolds at runtime.

Specifications come in two forms. Safety specifications assert that the system never enters a bad state. Liveness specifications assert that the system eventually does something good , that is, it asserts that the system is always able to make progress. These can be written using a Monitor . Writing safety properties Safety property specifications generalize the notion of source code assertions. A safety property violation is a finite execution that leads a system to an erroneous state. Coyote provides an API for writing assertions that specify safety properties that are local to a Coyote actor or task. In the Task programming model, you should use Specification.Assert (see Specification API ) and in the Actor programming model the corresponding API is Actor.Assert . In addition, Coyote also provides a way to specify global assertions that can describe the relationship across tasks or actors. Coyote provides the notion of a Monitor (see Monitor API ). It is a special kind of actor that can receive events but cannot send events to other actors. So it can only observe the execution of a program but not influence it: a desirable property when writing specifications in code. A Monitor is declared as follows: class GlobalSpec : Monitor { ... } The above code snippet declares a monitor named GlobalSpec . Unlike actors, monitors are not explicitly instantiated. Instead, they need to be registered with the Coyote runtime: ICoyoteRuntime runtime; runtime.RegisterMonitor<GlobalSpec>(); There can only be one instance of a given monitor type. Communication with this monitor happens via events: ICoyoteRuntime runtime; runtime.InvokeMonitor<GlobalSpec>(new CustomEvent(...)); Just like actors, monitors can have any number of fields, methods and states. The following is a simple example of a monitor. Let\u2019s say that there are two actors A and B that maintain two important variables called x and y , respectively. We want to assert that these two values are always within a difference of 5 between each other. There is no one assert that we can write that is local to A or B because both x and y live in different places. So we define a global Monitor that accepts events as soon as a variable is updated. Then it keeps asserting their values are within the required bound. public class UpdatedXEvent : Event { public int value { get; private set; } public UpdatedXEvent(int value) { this.value = value; } } public class UpdatedYEvent : Event { public int value { get; private set; } public UpdatedYEvent(int value) { this.value = value; } } class GlobalSpec : Monitor { // Current reading of x. int my_x; // Current reading of y. int my_y; [Start] [OnEntry(nameof(InitOnEntry))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpdatedXEvent), nameof(UpdatedXAction))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpdatedYEvent), nameof(UpdatedYAction))] class Init : State { } // Initialization. void InitOnEntry() { my_x = my_y = 0; } void UpdatedXAction(Event e) { my_x = (e as UpdatedXEvent).value; this.AssertSafety(); } void UpdatedYAction(Event e) { my_y = (e as UpdatedYEvent).value; this.AssertSafety(); } void AssertSafety() { this.Assert(Math.Abs(my_x - my_y) <= 5); } } In general, a monitor maintains local state of its own that is modified in response to events received from the program. This local state is used to maintain a history of the computation that is relevant to the property being monitored. An erroneous global behavior is flagged via an assertion on the private state of the safety monitor. Thus, a monitor cleanly separates the instrumentation state required for specification (inside the monitor) from the program state (outside the monitor). You can use monitors with the tasks programming model as well. Simply use Specification.RegisterMonitor and Specification.InvokeMonitor instead of the corresponding APIs in ICoyoteRuntime . A Task program can still use an ICoyoteRuntime if it wants to, the static methods are just provided as a convenience way to find the current ICoyoteRuntime . Writing liveness properties Liveness property specifications generalize the notion of non-termination . A liveness property violation is an infinite trace that exhibits lack of progress. Let\u2019s explain this concept through an example. Suppose that you are designing a replication protocol. The job of the protocol is to ensure that your data is replicated on, say, three different storage nodes. When a storage node fails, the protocol kicks in, reads the lost data from one of the alive replicas, and then creates a new replica on a different storage node. A natural specification for this protocol is that eventually it must establish three replicas for the data. In other words, it is unavoidable (on storage-node failure) that there are less-than-required number of replicas, but in that case the protocol must work towards creating the desired number of replicas again. A violation of this property is an (infinite) execution where a storage node fails but the protocol is not able to create the third replica, even when given an infinite amount of time. We keep talking about infinite behaviors here, but let\u2019s come back to that later. First, let us see how we can write this property as a monitor. A liveness monitor contains two special states: the hot and the cold state. The hot state denotes a point in the execution where progress is required, but has not happened yet; e.g. a node has failed, but a new one has not been created yet. A liveness monitor transitions to the hot state when it is notified that the system must make progress. A liveness monitor leaves the hot state and enters the cold state when it is notified that the system has progressed enough. An infinite execution is erroneous if the liveness monitor stays in the hot state for an infinitely long period of time. Consider the following example. class UpEvent : Event { } class DownEvent : Event { } class LivenessMonitor : Monitor { // current number of replicas alive. int alive = 0; [Start] [Hot] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpEvent),nameof(OnUp))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(DownEvent),nameof(OnDown))] class NotEnoughReplicas : State { } [Cold] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpEvent),nameof(OnUp))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(DownEvent),nameof(OnDown))] class EnoughReplicas : State { } // Notification that a new replica is up. void OnUp() { alive++; if (alive >= 3) { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<EnoughReplicas>(); } else { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<NotEnoughReplicas>(); } } // Notification that a replica has gone down. void OnDown() { alive--; if (alive >= 3) { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<EnoughReplicas>(); } else { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<NotEnoughReplicas>(); } } } This monitor has two states. It starts in a hot state NotEnoughReplicas and keeps track of the number of replicas alive in the system. It stays in the NotEnoughReplicas state as long as this number is below three, otherwise it transitions to the cold state EnoughReplicas . A program execution where this monitor gets stuck in the hot state demonstrates a violation of the correctness property of the replication protocol. Liveness monitors offer a natural way of describing properties of progress: things that must eventually happen in the system, where you cannot necessarily say (or its too cumbersome to say) exactly when the progress will happen. In practice, of course, you cannot wait for infinite executions: there is only a finite amount of time available to testing. The tester resorts to heuristics: it considers a sufficiently long and hot execution as a proxy for a liveness violation. You can configure a bound beyond which executions are considered infinite using the --liveness-temperature-threshold argument on the coyote test tool. Keep reading to learn more on how liveness checking all works.","title":"Program specifications"},{"location":"core/specifications/#program-specifications","text":"Coyote makes it easy to design and express system-level specifications that can be asserted during testing.

A program execution where this monitor gets stuck in the hot state demonstrates a violation of the correctness property of the replication protocol. Liveness monitors offer a natural way of describing properties of progress: things that must eventually happen in the system, where you cannot necessarily say (or its too cumbersome to say) exactly when the progress will happen. In practice, of course, you cannot wait for infinite executions: there is only a finite amount of time available to testing. The tester resorts to heuristics: it considers a sufficiently long and hot execution as a proxy for a liveness violation. You can configure a bound beyond which executions are considered infinite using the --liveness-temperature-threshold argument on the coyote test tool. Keep reading to learn more on how liveness checking all works.","title":"Writing liveness properties"},{"location":"core/systematic-testing/","text":"Systematic testing Coyote testing works by taking over the non-determinism in a program. Once it has control over the non-determinism, the Coyote tester will repeatedly run a test case, each time exercising a different set of non-deterministic choices, offering much better coverage than using other techniques. This powerful testing ability, however, does require help: you must mark all sources of non-determinism in a way that Coyote understands. Let\u2019s see how this is done. The first requirement is to use one of Coyote\u2019s supported programming models to express the concurrency. This can be fairly easy to do, but very important because Coyote tester is going to take over the scheduling of the program. In fact, the tester will complain if it detects concurrency that is outside its control. Take the simple example that was used to explain concurrency non-determinism . Notice the code below has replaced the .NET System.Threading.Tasks.Task type with Coyote\u2019s Task type, which is part of Coyote\u2019s asynchronous Task programming model , and is controlled during systematic testing. // Use the Coyote controlled task type. using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; // Shared variable x. int x = 0; int foo() { // Concurrent operations on x. var t1 = Task.Run(() => { x = 1; }); var t2 = Task.Run(() => { x = 2; }); // Join all. Task.WaitAll(t1, t2); } When this method foo now executes as part of a test case, the Coyote tester will understand that it is spawning two tasks that can run concurrently. The tester will explore different ways of executing the tasks to systematically cover all possibilities. Coyote provides multiple programming models . Just remember that whichever programming model you choose, you must express all the concurrency in that model itself. Coyote also offers APIs for expressing other forms of non-determinism. The CoyoteRuntime.Random API, for instance, returns a non-deterministic Boolean value. The exact value is chosen by the tester. This simple API can be used to build more complex mocks of external dependencies in the system. As an example, suppose that our code calls into an external service. Either this call returns successfully and the external service does the work that we requested, or it may timeout, or return an error code if the external service is unable to perform the work at the time. For testing your code, you will write a mock for it as follows: Status CallExternalServiceMock(WorkItem work) { if (CoyoteRuntime.Random()) { // Perform work. ... // Return success. return Status.Success; } else if (CoyoteRuntime.Random()) { // Return error code. return Status.ErrorCode1; } else if (CoyoteRuntime.Random()) { // Return error code. return Status.ErrorCode2; } else { // Timeout. return Status.Timeout; } } When using such a mock, the Coyote tester will control the values that Random returns in a way that provides good coverage. All these techniques can be put together to write very expressive test cases. A Coyote test has the power of encoding many different scenarios concisely and leave their exploration to the automated tester. Using Coyote has two main components. First, using one of Coyote\u2019s programming models to write the code. Second, designing mocks for external dependencies, capturing the sources of non-determinism that you want tested in your system. Additionally, Coyote also offers ways of writing specifications concisely.

State machines are now under the new Microsoft.Coyote.Actors namespace, to make it explicit that state machines are implementations of the actor programming model. The Monitor type is now under the Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications namespace. Type changes Machine was renamed to StateMachine to make it explicit that its a state machine. MachineState was renamed to State , as it is now a nested class inside StateMachine . MonitorState was renamed to State , as it is now a nested class inside Monitor . MachineId was renamed to ActorId , as state machines are implementations of the actor programming model. Halt was renamed to HaltEvent to make it explicit that its an event. Default was renamed to DefaultEvent to make it explicit that its an event. IMachineRuntime was renamed to IActorRuntime . IMachineRuntimeLog was renamed to IActorRuntimeLog . RuntimeLogWriter was renamed to ActorRuntimeLogWriter . Runtime API changes The static runtime factory was renamed from PSharpRuntime to RuntimeFactory , so you can now do RuntimeFactory.Create() to get an actor runtime instance (that can execute state machines). IMachineRuntime.CreateMachine was renamed to IActorRuntime.CreateActor . The previously deprecated method IMachineRuntime.CreateMachineAndExecute has been removed, please use IActorRuntime.CreateActorAndExecuteAsync instead (same semantics, just different method name). The previously deprecated method IMachineRuntime.SendEventAndExecute has been removed, please use IActorRuntime.SendEventAndExecuteAsync instead (same semantics, just different method name). Machine API changes Machine.CreateMachine was renamed StateMachine.CreateActor . Machine.Raise was renamed StateMachine.RaiseEvent to become more descriptive. Machine.Goto was renamed StateMachine.RaiseGotoStateEvent to become more descriptive. Machine.Push was renamed StateMachine.RaisePushStateEvent to become more descriptive. Machine.Pop was renamed StateMachine.RaisePopStateEvent to become more descriptive. Machine.Receive was renamed StateMachine.ReceiveEventAsync to become more descriptive. Machine.Send was renamed StateMachine.SendEvent to become more descriptive and match the runtime API. The ReceivedEvent property has been removed. You can now declare event handlers that take a single Event as an in-parameter, which is the Event that triggered the handler. A handler that does not require access to this Event can be still declared without an in-parameter. Some of the user callbacks (e.g. OnException and OnHaltAsync ) now give access to the last dequeued event. Introduced new API RaiseHaltEvent for raising the HaltEvent on yourself (this is more efficient than halting via a RaiseEvent ). Event API changes Halt (now HaltEvent ) can no longer be constructed, use HaltEvent.Instance instead to get access to a singleton instance created once to reduce unnecessary allocations. Monitor API changes Monitor.Raise was renamed to Monitor.RaiseEvent to become more descriptive. Similar to the Machine type, Goto is RaiseGotoStateEvent .

It helps you with design and implementation by providing high-level programming abstractions. It helps with testing by providing support for writing detailed system specifications and a very effective high-coverage testing tool . The integration of these features into the same product helps you iterate faster through the design-implement-test-revise cycle of software development. Coyote allows you to develop with confidence! That confidence comes from having your code changes be backed by powerful testing. This has allowed teams to move at a faster pace, often finishing features in a fraction of the time compared to developing with legacy techniques where the uncertainty of vetting corner-cases (especially with concurrency, failures, etc.) weighs you down heavily. The confidence also results in better performant code because Coyote helps you validate even highly-concurrent designs. Testing with Coyote is designed to be easy and effective. It removes the mystery associated with finding concurrency bugs and the pain associated with debugging them. Any bugs reported by the tester can be replayed: something that does not come for free otherwise for programs with concurrency. Coyote testing can be integrated with standard unit-testing frameworks, or easily parallelized for boosting coverage. It also makes it easy to visualize the coverage obtained for a test. Coyote is designed to be lightweight, adding minimal runtime overhead. It is easy to get started: simple design will have simple implementations, and a smooth on-ramp from simple to advanced usage of Coyote where the return on your investment depends on how much of Coyote you use in your system. Coyote has been battle-tested by Azure . There are several Azure services written using Coyote that are currently running live in production.

I\u2019m glad you asked. See how does it work . Will using Coyote affect the total budget for a software development project? It will have minimal impact initially, as developers ramp up on Coyote concepts. In the long run, our experience with Azure teams suggests that it will help reduce the total budget. Coyote is designed to add agility so that the development and testing processes move at a faster pace. What type of projects will benefit most from using Coyote? Projects that have to deal with concurrency/asynchrony or other non-deterministic issues (such as timers, failures and re-orderings). Will Coyote slow down my production code? No, Coyote is very lightweight. How much time will developers need to learn Coyote? We have been working hard towards making Coyote accessible to all developers, however, we cannot give a conclusive answer yet. We think that it won\u2019t take long. A junior engineer that recently joined an Azure team using Coyote said: \u201c being a new developer to the team, one of the first few things I worked on was Coyote, it was really quick to onboard, writing actual code is simple and straightforward \u201d. Tell us about your experience! At what stage of the development lifecycle is it best to start using Coyote? Ideally at the very beginning, since you need to design and build using Coyote APIs. It is better to do testing while developing, not after you are ready to ship :) How much additional effort is needed to test an existing system with Coyote? Depends on what programming model and concurrency APIs you used for developing your existing system because, for Coyote testing to work, it needs to understand the non-determinism in your system. In some cases, this may be as simple as replacing the System.Threading.Tasks.Task type with Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks.Task . In other cases, you would also have to model additional non-determinism, such as timers and external services. In general, we recommend using Coyote in early stages of development. How is Coyote being maintained and what level of support can we expect? Coyote is currently an Open Source project on GitHub under the MIT license. Microsoft continues to invest in Coyote and accepts community contributions as well. Issues can be posted there and will be resolved in a timely manner. How do Coyote actors compare against other actor frameworks? See How are Coyote Actors different from existing Microsoft Actor frameworks? . How is Coyote different from other similar systems out there? One comparison point for Coyote would be other offerings that help build reliable systems. It would be difficult to give an exhaustive answer here, but Coyote is quite unique in its combination of powerful testing and very light run-time requirements (i.e., it requires the .NET Core only). Other systems might require a buy-in to a particular distributed runtime or messaging system, or might not help much in the way of testing custom business logic. You can adapt Coyote to work with whatever platform you are using today. Is Coyote only available with Azure? No, Coyote can run in any Windows or Linux machine, regardless if it is a local machine or a VM on the cloud. How many machines do you need to run a Coyote program? A Coyote program is hosted in a .NET process, so it can easily run on just one machine. You can also create a distributed Coyote program by connecting multiple processes, each running Coyote. You are free to use any distributed host platform as well as any messaging system that you want. Can Coyote be used with any existing distributed host and communication platform? Yes, Coyote does not constrain you. Coyote is built on top of the .NET Task Parallel Library, and on its own only executes in-memory in the scope of a single .NET process. To build a distributed Coyote program, you are free to use any distributed host and communication mechanism that you like. All you need to do is host your .NET processes (that execute your Coyote code) using your favorite distributed system/framework (such as Kubernetes or Azure Service Fabric ) and connect these processes using your favorite communication/messaging mechanism (such as gRPC , Apache Kafka or Azure Service Bus ). To help you, there is a sample that shows how Coyote can be used with Azure Service Bus . Is it meaningful to use Coyote for a program that runs on a single machine only? Sure, in fact most testing with Coyote is performed on a single machine. Many Coyote users today build reliable cloud services, and Coyote itself is not service-specific. You can use it to build and test any kind of asynchronous .NET program that needs to be reliable.","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"overview/faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"overview/faq/#seems-magical-how-does-coyote-really-work","text":"I\u2019m glad you asked.

There are two parts to how Coyote works. First you need to write some code that uses the Coyote programming model. This code then provides the metadata needed to enable the coyote test tool to do its magic. The coyote test tool takes over the scheduling of a Coyote program. It is able to do this reliably because it deeply understands the required Coyote programming models . Therefore, the tool knows all concurrent operations in a test as well as sources of synchronization between them. By controlling the scheduling, the tool can reliably explore different interleavings of operations. The tool will repeatedly run a test, each time exercising different scheduling choices. This methodology has proven to be very effective at providing high coverage, especially concurrency coverage, in a short amount of time. In a similar way, the tool can also take over other sources of non-determinism, such as the delivery of timeout messages or injection of failures. If a bug is found, the coyote test tool reports a reproducible bug trace that provides the global order of all scheduling decisions and nondeterministic choices made during the execution of a test. The trace can be replayed reliably over and over again, until the bug is identified. This makes a bug reported by the tool significantly easier to debug than regular unit-/integration-tests and logs from production or stress tests, which are typically nondeterministic. No more Heisenbugs ! The exact mechanism Coyote uses to do this depends on the programming model you have chosen. For the Task model, the coyote test tool is able to intercept all task creation operations by overriding various .NET Task methods. For the Actor model the coyote test tool can control when messages are dequeued by each Actor and therefore control the overall message scheduling. The next step is to pick a search strategy that explores all possible interleavings of asynchronous operations. The coyote test tool uses several state-of-the-art exploration strategies that have been known to find very deep bugs easily. The tool can run a portfolio of available strategies in parallel, maximizing chances of revealing bugs. Coyote refers to these exploration strategies as scheduling strategies and makes it easy to incorporate new strategies, as they come out of research. New scheduling strategies are being developed in Microsoft Research based on a wealth of experience gathered from the Microsoft product groups that are using Coyote today. See case studies .

Coyote is a set of .NET libraries and tools designed to help ensure that your code is free of bugs. Too often developers are drowning in the complexity of their own code and many hours are wasted trying to track down impossible-to-find bugs, especially when dealing with concurrent code or various other sources of non-determinism (like message ordering, failures, timeouts and so on). Coyote provides programming models to express concurrent systems. These programming models offer convenient ways to program at a high-level of abstraction. As mentioned below, Coyote currently supports two programming models: a familiar tasks-based programming model (currently in-preview) as well as a more advanced actor-based programming model. These programming models are built using asynchronous APIs, supported by a lightweight runtime, making it easy to program efficient non-blocking code. Coyote helps write powerful, expressive tests for your code. You can declare sources of non-determinism (such as timers, failures, etc.) as part of your tests. The Coyote testing tool can systematically explore a large number of interleavings of concurrent operations as well as non-deterministic choices so that it covers a large set of behaviors in a very short time. This is different from stress testing . Coyote takes control of the concurrency so that it can manipulate every possible scheduling. With appropriate mocking , Coyote can also do this in \u201cdeveloper\u201d mode on a single laptop with little or no dependence on the bigger production environment. Coyote is not a verification system. It does not use theorem proving to make correctness guarantees, instead it uses intelligent search strategies to drive systematic testing, based on deep understanding of concurrency primitives that you have used in your code. This approach has proven to work well for large production teams, including many teams in Microsoft Azure because it has a small barrier to entry with almost immediate benefits for those who adopt it. Coyote does not require that a team starts from scratch and rebuild their system. Often it is too expensive to start over. Instead Coyote can be adopted gradually, adding more and more structure around your Coyote-aware code. The more of this structure you add the more benefit you get from Coyote, but it is certainly not an all or nothing proposition. So Coyote brings together elements of design, development and testing into an integrated package that works really well in the real world. See our case studies for some great customer testimonials. var captions = [[0, \"This animation shows messages passing through a highly parallel distributed system.\"], [5, \"Each node represents a microservice or a piece of code running on some machine.\"], [10, \"Messages are flying through this system in a way that makes it hard to debug when something goes wrong.\"], [16, \"Coyote tests one async path at a time exploring all possible paths through the system and it does this very quickly\"], [23, \"It also records this path so that when it finds a bug that bug is 100% reproducible.\"] ]; function show_captions(video, caption){ var time = video.currentTime; var line = null; for (var i = 0; i < captions.length; i++) { var nextline = captions[i]; if (nextline[0] > time) break; line = nextline; } if (line != null) { caption.style.display=\"block\"; caption.innerHTML = line[1] } else { caption.style.display=\"none\"; } } $(document).ready(function () { video = $(\"#shortintro\")[0]; caption = $(\"#caption\")[0]; caption.style.display=\"none\"; video.ontimeupdate = function() { show_captions(video, caption); }; }); Supported programming models Coyote supports two main programming models: Asynchronous tasks , which follows the popular task-based asynchronous pattern . This programming model offers a Task type that serves as a drop-in-replacement type for the native .NET System.Threading.Tasks.Task . As with the native Task , a Coyote Task represents an asynchronous operation that the programmer can coordinate using the async and await keywords of C# . In production, a Coyote Task executes with the same semantics of a native Task . In fact, it is simply a thin wrapper around a native Task object. During testing, however, is where the magic happens. Coyote controls the execution of each Coyote Task so that it can explore various different interleavings to find bugs. Alternatively, you can use the binary rewriting feature of Coyote to automatically instrument your application, taking control of System.Threading.Tasks.Task objects and related concurrency types from the Task Parallel Library, without having to use Coyote\u2019s drop-in-replacement library. Asynchronous actors is an actor-based programming model that allows you to express your design and concurrency at a higher-level of abstraction. This programming model starts with the Actor type that represents a long-lived, interactive asynchronous object. An actor can create new actors, send events to other actors, and handle received events. This more advanced programming model is ideal for cases when asynchronous tasks get too unwieldy. This programming model also provides a StateMachine type for easy development of event-driven state-machines. A StateMachine is simply an Actor with explicit States and event-driven state transitions. Note that you can only systematically test the above two programming models together using Coyote\u2019s binary rewriting to take control of System.Threading.Tasks.Task objects. Mixing the Coyote Actor type with the custom Coyote Task type is not supported.","title":"What is Coyote?"},{"location":"overview/what-is-coyote/#what-is-coyote","text":"Coyote is a set of .NET libraries and tools designed to help ensure that your code is free of bugs.

With appropriate mocking , Coyote can also do this in \u201cdeveloper\u201d mode on a single laptop with little or no dependence on the bigger production environment. Coyote is not a verification system. It does not use theorem proving to make correctness guarantees, instead it uses intelligent search strategies to drive systematic testing, based on deep understanding of concurrency primitives that you have used in your code. This approach has proven to work well for large production teams, including many teams in Microsoft Azure because it has a small barrier to entry with almost immediate benefits for those who adopt it. Coyote does not require that a team starts from scratch and rebuild their system. Often it is too expensive to start over. Instead Coyote can be adopted gradually, adding more and more structure around your Coyote-aware code. The more of this structure you add the more benefit you get from Coyote, but it is certainly not an all or nothing proposition. So Coyote brings together elements of design, development and testing into an integrated package that works really well in the real world.

This programming model offers a Task type that serves as a drop-in-replacement type for the native .NET System.Threading.Tasks.Task . As with the native Task , a Coyote Task represents an asynchronous operation that the programmer can coordinate using the async and await keywords of C# . In production, a Coyote Task executes with the same semantics of a native Task . In fact, it is simply a thin wrapper around a native Task object. During testing, however, is where the magic happens. Coyote controls the execution of each Coyote Task so that it can explore various different interleavings to find bugs. Alternatively, you can use the binary rewriting feature of Coyote to automatically instrument your application, taking control of System.Threading.Tasks.Task objects and related concurrency types from the Task Parallel Library, without having to use Coyote\u2019s drop-in-replacement library. Asynchronous actors is an actor-based programming model that allows you to express your design and concurrency at a higher-level of abstraction. This programming model starts with the Actor type that represents a long-lived, interactive asynchronous object. An actor can create new actors, send events to other actors, and handle received events. This more advanced programming model is ideal for cases when asynchronous tasks get too unwieldy. This programming model also provides a StateMachine type for easy development of event-driven state-machines. A StateMachine is simply an Actor with explicit States and event-driven state transitions. Note that you can only systematically test the above two programming models together using Coyote\u2019s binary rewriting to take control of System.Threading.Tasks.Task objects. Mixing the Coyote Actor type with the custom Coyote Task type is not supported.","title":"Supported programming models"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/actor-semantics/","text":"Actor semantics An Actor in Coyote is an in-memory object. The main APIs that define the semantics of programming with actors are CreateActor , which is used to create a new Actor instance, and SendEvent that is used to pass an event to an existing Actor . It is useful to understand both the synchronous and asynchronous guarantees of these methods. Semantics of actor creation Suppose you create an Actor as follows: ActorId clientId = this.CreateActor(typeof(Client)); This call synchronously creates the inbox of the actor. The initialization of the new actor happens asynchronously in the background. Think of this as follows: the call takes only as long as it takes to create an inbox. It does not wait for the initialization code of the target actor to finish. This is enough to guarantee that you can start sending messages to the new actor immediately after creating it. Basically, if you have an ActorId , then you can send messages to it. The Coyote runtime will initialize the new actor in the background, and ensure that its initialization finishes before letting the actor process its inbox. Semantics of actor messages Actors in Coyote have both in-order as well as causal-delivery semantics. Lets break down this guarantee into pieces. If one actor sends two messages to another actor as follows: this.SendEvent(id, e1); this.SendEvent(id, e2); Then it is guaranteed that e1 will be delivered to the inbox of id before e2 . This is the in-order part of the message-delivery semantics. To explain causal delivery, we need to consider three actors A , B and C . Suppose that A first sends a message e1 to C and then it sends a message e2 to B . Next, B is programmed so that whenever it receives a message e2 , it will forward it to C . For this program, the message e1 is guaranteed to reach the inbox of C before e2 . There is a simple way of thinking about this guarantee. The call to SendEvent ensures that the message is delivered to the inbox of the target before it returns. (It does not wait for the message to be processed\u2014that can happen asynchronously.) Thus, when A sent message e1 to C , it was delivered to the inbox of C even before the message e2 was sent out. Thus, e2 had no chance of overtaking e1 to reach the inbox of C first. Distributed systems modeling Suppose that you have written a distributed system where each node of the system is running its own set of Coyote actors and these actors communicate over the network. When you write a Coyote test for checking end-to-end behaviors (by using a mock of the network to connect all the remote nodes together in the same test), then be sure to consider the difference in the delivery semantics of the network and the Coyote API SendEvent . Usually, real networks will provide more relaxed guarantees than SendEvent for performance reasons. Closing this gap requires modeling. For instance, a network that can either lose a message, deliver it once, or deliver it twice can be modeled as follows: if(this.Random()) { this.SendEvent(destination, message); } if(this.Random()) { this.SendEvent(destination, message); } See also State machine semantics .","title":"Actor semantics"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/actor-semantics/#actor-semantics","text":"An Actor in Coyote is an in-memory object.

EventGroup GetCurrentEventGroup(ActorId actorId); The CurrentEventGroup is automatically passed along whenever you use CreateActor or SendEvent as shown below: EventGroup The base EventGroup class contains the following: public Guid Id { get; internal set; } public string Name { get; internal set; } The Guid is automatically assigned to Guid.Empty .

Then you can await on this object for the result. In this way you can asynchronously return a result from a collection of actors that are performing some job. SetResult also sets IsCompleted to true. Clearing the CurrentEventGroup You might need to clear the current event group at some point in your Actor . To do this you can simply set the property to null: this.CurrentEventGroup = null; However, this could be overridden by any subsequent event that is dequeued from the event queue. If you do not want the CurrentEventGroup to be passed along to the target actor you can pass a special EventGroup.Null event group like this: this.SendEvent(target, e, EventGroup.Null); This will put a null in the event queue of the target actor so that when this event is dequeued the CurrentEventGroup of the target actor will be set to null .

This model is similar to how real people interact asynchronously via email. Each Coyote actor has an inbox for events, event handlers, as well as normal class fields and methods. Actors run concurrently with respect to each other, but individually they handle their input queue in a sequential way. When an event arrives, the actor dequeues that event from the input queue and handles it by executing a sequence of operations. Each operation might update a field, create a new actor, or send an event to another actor. In Coyote, creating actors and sending events are both non-blocking operations. In the case of a send operation the message (or event) is simply enqueued into the input queue of the target actor and, most importantly, it does not wait for the message to be processed at the target before returning control to the sender. The actor model also provides a specialized type of actor called a StateMachine . State machines are actors that have explicitly declared states and state transitions. Every object oriented class that has member variables is really also just a state machine where that state is updated as methods are called, but sometimes this gets really complicated and hard to test. Formal state machines help you model your states more explicitly and coyote tester can help you find bugs by exploring different state transitions using information you provide declaring how various types of events causes those state transitions. See also: how are Coyote Actors different from existing Microsoft Actor frameworks? . Declaring and creating actors An actor based program in Coyote is a normal .NET program that also uses the Actor or StateMachine base classes from the Microsoft.Coyote.Actors namespace, as well as the Event base class from the Microsoft.Coyote namespace. Actors can be declared in the following way: using Microsoft.Coyote.Actors; class Client : Actor { ... } class Server : Actor { ... } The above code declares two actors named Client and Server . Being a C# class you can also declare fields, properties and methods. An actor can create an instance of another actor and send Events using the following Actor methods: ActorId clientId = this.CreateActor(typeof(Client)); this.SendEvent(this.ClientId, new PingEvent()); When an event is being sent, it is enqueued in the event queue of the target actor. The coyote runtime will at some point dequeue the received event, and allow the target actor to handle it asynchronously. All actors in Coyote have an associated unique ActorId which identifies a specific instance of that type. Note that Coyote never gives you the actual object reference for an actor instance. This ensures your code does not get too tightly coupled. By limiting yourself to the Coyote API\u2019s for interacting with an actor, you also get all the benefits of coyote test in terms of understanding more deeply how to test all asynchronous interactions and ensure your specifications are maintained correctly. There is a lot of literature on actor models that explain in more depth the importance of this message passing programming model which is especially popular in the world of distributed systems. Event based programming is also popular in User Interface development and even shows up in low level embedded systems. It is a powerful tool for solving the tangled web of complexity that happens with less disciplined architectures. Starting a Coyote actor-based program To create the first instance of an Actor you need to initialize the Coyote actor runtime inside your C# process (typically in the Main method). An example of this is the following: using Microsoft.Coyote; using Microsoft.Coyote.Actors; using Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting; using System; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { IActorRuntime runtime = RuntimeFactory.Create(); Execute(runtime); Console.ReadLine(); } [Test] public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { ActorId serverId = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Server)); } } You must first import the Coyote runtime library ( Microsoft.Coyote.dll ), which you can get from NuGet , then create a runtime instance (of type IActorRuntime ) which you pass to a [Test] method. The test method named Execute will be the entry point that is used during testing of your Coyote program. In this case it simply invokes the CreateActor method of the runtime to instantiate the first Coyote actor (of type Server in the above example). The CreateActor method accepts as a parameter the type of the actor to be instantiated, and returns the ActorId representing that actor instance and this bootstraps a series of asynchronous events that handle initialization of that actor and any operations it performs during initialization. Because CreateActor is an asynchronous method, we call the Console.ReadLine method, which pauses the main thread until some console input has been given, so that the host C# program does not exit prematurely. The IActorRuntime interface also provides the SendEvent method for sending events to a Coyote actor. This method accepts as parameters an object of type ActorId and an event object. It also has a couple more advanced parameters which you don\u2019t need to worry about right now. An event can be created by sub-classing from Microsoft.Coyote.Event : class PingEvent : Event { public readonly ActorId Caller; public PingEvent(ActorId caller) { this.Caller = caller; } } class PongEvent : Event { } An event can contain members of any type (including scalar values or references to object) and when an event is sent to a target actor there is no deep-copying of those members, for performance reasons. The target actor will be able to see the Event object and cast it to a specific type to extract the information it needs. Now you can write a complete actor, declaring what type of events it can handle: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(PingEvent), nameof(HandlePing))] class Server : Actor { public void HandlePing(Event e) { PingEvent ping = (PingEvent)e; Console.WriteLine(\"Server handling ping\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Server sending pong back to caller\"); this.SendEvent(ping.Caller, new PongEvent()); } } This Server is an Actor that can receive PingEvent . The PingEvent contains the ActorId of the caller and the Server uses that to send back a PongEvent in response. An event handler controls how a machine reacts to a received event. It is clearly just a method so you can do anything there, including creating one or more actor instances, sending one or more events, updating some private state or invoking some 3rd party library. To complete this Coyote program, you can provide the following implementation of the Client actor: using System.Threading.Tasks; class SetupEvent : Event { public readonly ActorId ServerId; public SetupEvent(ActorId server) { this.ServerId = server; } } [OnEventDoAction(typeof(PongEvent), nameof(HandlePong))] class Client : Actor { public ActorId ServerId; protected override Task OnInitializeAsync(Event initialEvent) { Console.WriteLine(\"{0} initializing\", this.Id); this.ServerId = ((SetupEvent)initialEvent).ServerId; Console.WriteLine(\"{0} sending ping event to server\", this.Id); this.SendEvent(this.ServerId, new PingEvent(this.Id)); return base.OnInitializeAsync(initialEvent); } void HandlePong() { Console.WriteLine(\"{0} received pong event\", this.Id); } } This Client is an Actor that sends PingEvents to a server. This means the Client needs to know the ActorId of the Server . This can be done using an initialEvent passed to OnInitializeAsync . The Client then uses this ActorId to send a PingEvent to the Server . When the Server responds with a PongEvent the HandlePong method is called because of the OnEventDoAction declaration on the class. Notice in this case the HandlePong event handler takes no Event argument. The Event argument is optional on Coyote event handlers. Note that HandlePong could also be defined as an async Task method. Async handlers are allowed so that you can call external async systems in your production code, but this has some restrictions. You are not allowed to directly create parallel tasks inside an actor (e.g. by using Task.Run ) as that can introduce race conditions (if you need to parallelize a workload, you can simply create more actors). Also, during testing, you should not use Task.Delay or Task.Yield in your event handlers. It is ok to have truly async behavior in production, but at test time the coyote test tool wants to know about, so that it can control, all async behavior of your actor. If it detects some uncontrolled async behavior an error will be reported. One last remaining bit of code is needed in your Program to complete this example, namely, you need to create the Client actor in the Execute method, in fact, you can create as many Client actors as you want to make this an interesting test: public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { ActorId serverId = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Server)); runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId)); runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId)); runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId)); } The output of the program will be something like this: Client(3) initializing Client(3) sending ping event to server Client(1) initializing Client(2) initializing Client(2) sending ping event to server Client(1) sending ping event to server Server handling ping from Client(1) Server sending pong back to caller Client(1) received pong event Server handling ping from Client(3) Server sending pong back to caller Server handling ping from Client(2) Server sending pong back to caller Client(2) received pong event Client(3) received pong event The CreateActor and SendEvent methods are non-blocking so you can see those operations are interleaved in the log output. The Coyote runtime will take care of all the underlying concurrency using the Task Parallel Library, which means that you do not need to explicitly create and manage tasks. However, you must be careful not to share data between actors because accessing that shared data from multiple actors at once could lead to race conditions. You can reduce race conditions in your code if you use events to transfer data from one actor to another. But since it is a reference model without deep copy semantics, you can actually share data between actors if you really need to. See sharing objects for more information in this advanced topic. Assertions Coyote also supports specifying invariants through assertions. You can do this by using the Assert method, which accepts as input a predicate that must always hold in that specific program point, e.g. this.Assert(k == 0) , which holds if the integer k equals to 0 . These Assert statement are useful for local invariants, i.e., they are about the state of a single actor. For global invariants it is recommended that you use Monitors .

An event can be created by sub-classing from Microsoft.Coyote.Event : class PingEvent : Event { public readonly ActorId Caller; public PingEvent(ActorId caller) { this.Caller = caller; } } class PongEvent : Event { } An event can contain members of any type (including scalar values or references to object) and when an event is sent to a target actor there is no deep-copying of those members, for performance reasons. The target actor will be able to see the Event object and cast it to a specific type to extract the information it needs. Now you can write a complete actor, declaring what type of events it can handle: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(PingEvent), nameof(HandlePing))] class Server : Actor { public void HandlePing(Event e) { PingEvent ping = (PingEvent)e; Console.WriteLine(\"Server handling ping\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Server sending pong back to caller\"); this.SendEvent(ping.Caller, new PongEvent()); } } This Server is an Actor that can receive PingEvent . The PingEvent contains the ActorId of the caller and the Server uses that to send back a PongEvent in response. An event handler controls how a machine reacts to a received event. It is clearly just a method so you can do anything there, including creating one or more actor instances, sending one or more events, updating some private state or invoking some 3rd party library. To complete this Coyote program, you can provide the following implementation of the Client actor: using System.Threading.Tasks; class SetupEvent : Event { public readonly ActorId ServerId; public SetupEvent(ActorId server) { this.ServerId = server; } } [OnEventDoAction(typeof(PongEvent), nameof(HandlePong))] class Client : Actor { public ActorId ServerId; protected override Task OnInitializeAsync(Event initialEvent) { Console.WriteLine(\"{0} initializing\", this.Id); this.ServerId = ((SetupEvent)initialEvent).ServerId; Console.WriteLine(\"{0} sending ping event to server\", this.Id); this.SendEvent(this.ServerId, new PingEvent(this.Id)); return base.OnInitializeAsync(initialEvent); } void HandlePong() { Console.WriteLine(\"{0} received pong event\", this.Id); } } This Client is an Actor that sends PingEvents to a server. This means the Client needs to know the ActorId of the Server . This can be done using an initialEvent passed to OnInitializeAsync . The Client then uses this ActorId to send a PingEvent to the Server . When the Server responds with a PongEvent the HandlePong method is called because of the OnEventDoAction declaration on the class. Notice in this case the HandlePong event handler takes no Event argument. The Event argument is optional on Coyote event handlers. Note that HandlePong could also be defined as an async Task method. Async handlers are allowed so that you can call external async systems in your production code, but this has some restrictions. You are not allowed to directly create parallel tasks inside an actor (e.g. by using Task.Run ) as that can introduce race conditions (if you need to parallelize a workload, you can simply create more actors). Also, during testing, you should not use Task.Delay or Task.Yield in your event handlers. It is ok to have truly async behavior in production, but at test time the coyote test tool wants to know about, so that it can control, all async behavior of your actor. If it detects some uncontrolled async behavior an error will be reported. One last remaining bit of code is needed in your Program to complete this example, namely, you need to create the Client actor in the Execute method, in fact, you can create as many Client actors as you want to make this an interesting test: public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { ActorId serverId = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Server)); runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId)); runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId)); runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId)); } The output of the program will be something like this: Client(3) initializing Client(3) sending ping event to server Client(1) initializing Client(2) initializing Client(2) sending ping event to server Client(1) sending ping event to server Server handling ping from Client(1) Server sending pong back to caller Client(1) received pong event Server handling ping from Client(3) Server sending pong back to caller Server handling ping from Client(2) Server sending pong back to caller Client(2) received pong event Client(3) received pong event The CreateActor and SendEvent methods are non-blocking so you can see those operations are interleaved in the log output. The Coyote runtime will take care of all the underlying concurrency using the Task Parallel Library, which means that you do not need to explicitly create and manage tasks. However, you must be careful not to share data between actors because accessing that shared data from multiple actors at once could lead to race conditions. You can reduce race conditions in your code if you use events to transfer data from one actor to another. But since it is a reference model without deep copy semantics, you can actually share data between actors if you really need to.

This means that two different actors should not race on access to the same object, unless both accesses are reads. Typically, you should build your application with an ownership protocol in mind to associate a unique owner actor to an object when writes have to be performed on that object. An exception to this rule is when using the thread-safe in-memory data structures provided by the Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.SharedObjects namespace. Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.SharedObjects Coyote provides multiple thread-safe in-memory data structures that help simplify writing actor programs. Instances of these data structures can be shared freely and accessed by multiple actors, even when performing write operations. There is a simple API for creating these shared data structures. Currently three kinds of shared data structures are available: SharedCounter , SharedRegister<T> and SharedDictionary . The following code snippet creates and initializes a SharedRegister . It then sends the register to a different actor m by stashing it as part of the payload of an event. SharedRegister<int> register = SharedRegister.Create<int>(this.Id.Runtime); register.SetValue(100); this.SendEvent(m, new MyEvent(register, ...)); var v = register.GetValue(); this.Assert(v == 100 || v == 200); Let\u2019s suppose that the target actors m , when it gets this MyEvent message, gets the register and does register.SetValue(200) . In this case, a read of the register in the source actor can either return the original value 100 or the value 200 set by m . In this way, these shared objects offer convenient ways of sharing data between actors (without going through explicit message creation, send, receive, etc.). Furthermore, if the assertion at the end of the code snippet shown above was this.Assert(v == 100) then the tester will be able to find and report a violation of the assertion because it understands SharedRegister operations as a source of synchronization. Internally, these data structures are written so that they use efficient thread-safe implementations in production runs of a Coyote program. For instance, SharedCounter uses Interlocked operations, SharedRegister uses small critical sections implemented using locks and SharedDictionary uses a ConcurrentDictionary . However, during test mode (i.e., while running tests under coyote test ) the implementation automatically switches to use an actor that serializes all accesses to the object. Thus, coyote test sees a normal Coyote program with no synchronization operations other than actor creation and message passing.

Important remark on using SharedDictionary<TKey, TValue> Conceptually you should think of a Coyote SharedObject as a wrapper around a Coyote actor. Thus, you need to be careful about stashing references inside a SharedObject and treat it in the same manner as sharing references between actors. In the case of a SharedDictionary both the key and the value (which are passed by reference into the dictionary) should not be mutated unless first removed from the dictionary because this can lead to a data race. Consider two actors that share a SharedDictionary object D . If both actors grab the value D[k] at the same key k they will each have a reference to the same object, creating the potential for a data race (unless the intention is to only do read operations on that object). The same note holds for SharedRegister<T> when T is a struct type with reference fields inside it. What about System.Collections.Concurrent? Yes, you can use the .NET thread safe collections to share information across actors but not the BlockingCollection as this can block and Coyote will not know about that which will lead to deadlocks during testing. The other thread safe collections do not have uncontrolled non-determinism, either from Task.Run, or from retry loops, timers or waits.

A state machine adds State semantics with explicit information about how Events can trigger State changes in a StateMachine . You can write a state machine version of the Server class shown in Programming model: asynchronous actors like this: class ReadyEvent : Event { } class Server : StateMachine { [Start] [OnEntry(nameof(InitOnEntry))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(ReadyEvent), typeof(Active))] class Init : State { } void InitOnEntry() { this.RaiseEvent(new ReadyEvent()); } [OnEventDoAction(typeof(PingEvent), nameof(HandlePing))] class Active : State { } void HandlePing(Event e) { var pe = (PingEvent)e; Console.WriteLine(\"Server received ping event from {0}\", pe.Caller.Name); this.SendEvent(pe.Caller, new PongEvent()); } } The above class declares a state machine named Server . The StateMachine class itself inherits from Actor so state machines are also actors and, of course, state machines are also normal C# classes. Actors and StateMachines can talk to each other by sending events. State machines in Coyote must also declare one or more states where a state is a nested class that inherits from the coyote State class which is a nested class inside StateMachine . The nested state classes can be private. The above code snippet declares two states in the Server machine: Init and Active . You must use the Start attribute to declare one of the states the initial state, which will be the first state that the machine will transition to upon initialization. In this example, the Init state has been declared as the initial state of Server . A state declaration can optionally be decorated with a number of state-specific attributes, as seen in the [Init] state: [OnEntry(nameof(InitOnEntry))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(ReadyEvent), typeof(Active))] The OnEntry attribute denotes an action that will be executed when the machine transitions to the Init state, while the OnExit attribute denotes an action that will be executed when the machine leaves the state. Actions in Coyote are C# methods that take either no input parameters or a single input parameter of type Event , and return either void or async Task . OnExit actions cannot receive an Event argument. Note that Coyote actions are also referred to as event handlers, however these should not be confused with the System.EventHandler , which have a different prototype. Notice that the InitOnEntry method declared above is similar to the original OnInitializeAsync method on the Server Actor. The RaiseEvent call is used to trigger the state transition defined in the OnEventGotoState custom attribute, in this case it is ready to transition to the Active state: this.RaiseEvent(new ReadyEvent()); The RaiseEvent call is used to send an event to yourself. Similar to SendEvent , when a machine raises an event on itself, it is also queued so that the method can continue execution until the InitOnEntry method is completed. When control returns to the coyote runtime, instead of dequeuing the next event from the inbox (if there is one), the machine immediately handles the raised event (so raised events are prioritized over any events in the inbox). This prioritization is important in the above case, because it guarantees that the Server will transition to the Active state before the PingEvent is received from the Client . The attribute OnEventGotoState indicates that if the state machine receives the ReadyEvent event while it is currently in the Init state, it will automatically handle the ReadyEvent by exiting the Init state and transitioning to the Active state. This saves you from having to write that trivial event handler logic. All this happens as a result of the simple RaiseEvent call and the OnEventGotoState attribute. The Coyote state machine programming model takes a lot of tedium out of managing explicit state machinery. If you ever find yourself building your own state machinery, then you definitely should consider using the Coyote state machine class instead. Note that on a given State of a state machine, you can only define one handler for a given event type. When you run this new StateMachine based Server you will see the same output as before, with the addition of the state information from HandlePong : Program+Client(2) initializing Program+Client(2) sending ping event to server Program+Client(1) initializing Program+Client(1) sending ping event to server Program+Client(3) initializing Program+Client(3) sending ping event to server Server received ping event from Program+Client(2) Server received ping event from Program+Client(1) Server received ping event from Program+Client(3) Program+Client(2) received pong event Program+Client(3) received pong event Program+Client(1) received pong event Unlike Actors which declare the events they can receive at the class level, StateMachines can also declare this information on the States . This gives StateMachines more fine grained control, for example, perhaps you want your state machine to only be able to receive a certain type of event when it is in a particular state. In an Actor you would need to check this yourself and throw an exception, whereas in a state machine this is more declarative and is enforced by the Coyote runtime; the Coyote runtime will report an error if an event is received on a State of a StateMachine that was not expecting to receive that event. This reduces the amount of tedious book keeping code you need to write, and keeps your code even cleaner. For an example of a state machine in action see the state machine demo . Goto, push and pop states Besides RaiseEvent , state machine event handlers can request a state change in code rather than depending on OnEventGotoState attributes. This allows conditional goto operations as shown in the following example: void InitOnEntry() { if (this.Random()) { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Active>(); } else { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Busy>(); } } State machines can also push and pop states, effectively creating a stack of active states. Use [OnEventPushState(...)] or RaisePushStateEvent in code to push a new state: this.RaisePushStateEvent<Active>(); This will push the Active state on the stack, but it will also inherit some actions declared on the Init state. The Active state can pop itself off the stack, returning to the Init state using a RaisePopStateEvent call: void HandlePing() { Console.WriteLine(\"Server received ping event while in the {0} state\", this.CurrentState.Name); this.RaisePopStateEvent(); // pop the current state off the stack of active states. } Note that this does not result in the OnEntry method being called again, because you never actually exited the Init state in this case. But if you used RaiseGotoStateEvent instead of RaisePushStateEvent and RaisePopStateEvent then InitOnEntry will be called again, and that would make our Server toggle back and forth between the Init and Active states. The push and pop feature is considered an advanced feature of state machines. It is designed to help you reuse some of your event handling code, where you can put \u201ccommon event handling\u201d in lower states and more specific event handling in pushed states. If an event handler is defined more than once in the stack, the one closest to the top of the stack is used. Only one Raise* operation per action There is an important restriction on the use of the following. Only one of these operations can be queued up per event handling action: RaiseEvent RaiseGotoStateEvent RaisePushStateEvent RaisePopStateEvent RaiseHaltEvent A runtime Assert will be raised if you accidentally try and do two of these operations in a single action. For example, this would be an error because you are trying to do two Raise operations in the InitOnEntry action: void InitOnEntry() { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Active>(); this.RaiseEvent(new TestEvent()); } Deferring and ignoring events Coyote also provides the capability to defer and ignore events while in a particular state: [DeferEvents(typeof(PingEvent), typeof(PongEvent))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(ReadyEvent))] class SomeState : State { } The attribute DeferEvents indicates that the PingEvent and PongEvent events should not be dequeued while the machine is in the state SomeState . Instead, the machine should skip over PingEvent and PongEvent (without dropping these events from the queue) and dequeue the next event that is not being deferred. Note that when a state decides to defer an event a subsequent pushed state can choose to receive that event if it wants to, but if the pushed state chooses not to receive the event then it is not an error and it remains deferred. The attribute IgnoreEvents indicates that whenever ReadyEvent is dequeued while the machine is in SomeState , then the machine should drop ReadyEvent without invoking any action. Note that when a state decides to ignore an event a subsequent pushed state can choose to receive that event if it wants to, but if the pushed state chooses not to receive the event then it is not an error and the event will be ignored and dropped. Default events State machines support an interesting concept called default events . A state can request that something be done by default when there is nothing else to do. [OnEventDoAction(typeof(DefaultEvent), nameof(OnIdle))] class Idle : State { } public void OnIdle() { Console.WriteLine(\"OnIdle\"); } The Coyote runtime will invoke this action handler when Idle is the current active state and the state machine has nothing else to do (the inbox has no events that can be processed). If nothing else happens, (no other actionable events are queued on this state machine) then the OnIdle method will be called over and over until something else changes. It is more efficient to use CreatePeriodicTimer for low priority work. Default events can also invoke goto, and push state transitions, which brings up an interesting case where you can actually implement an infinite ping pong using the following: internal class PingPongMachine : StateMachine { [Start] [OnEntry(nameof(OnPing))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(DefaultEvent), typeof(Pong))] public class Ping : State { } public void OnPing() { Console.WriteLine(\"OnPing\"); } [OnEntry(nameof(OnPong))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(DefaultEvent), typeof(Ping))] public class Pong : State { } void OnPong() { Console.WriteLine(\"OnPong\"); } } The difference between this and a timer based ping-pong is that this will run as fast as the Coyote runtime can go. So you have to be careful using DefaultEvents like this as it could use up a lot of CPU time. WildCard events State machines also support a special WildcardEvent which acts as a special pattern matching event that matches all event types. This means you can create generic actions, or state transitions as a result of receiving any event (except the DefaultEvent ). The following example shows how the WildcardEvent can be used: internal class WildMachine : StateMachine { [Start] [OnEntry(nameof(OnInit))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(WildCardEvent), typeof(CatchAll))] public class Init : State { } public void OnInit() { Console.WriteLine(\"Entering state {0}\", this.CurrentStateName); } [OnEntry(nameof(OnInit))] [OnEntry(nameof(OnCatchAll))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(WildCardEvent), nameof(OnCatchAll))] public class CatchAll : State { } void OnCatchAll(Event e) { Console.WriteLine(\"Catch all state caught event of type {0}\", e.GetType().Name); } } The client of this state machine can send any event it wants and it will cause a transition to the CatchAll state where it will be handled by the OnCatchAll method. For example: class X : Event { }; var actor = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(WildMachine)); runtime.SendEvent(actor, new X()); And the output of this test is: Entering state Init Entering state CatchAll Catch all state caught event of type X Precise semantics There is a lot of interesting combinations of things that you can do with DeferEvents , IgnoreEvents , OnEventDoAction , OnEventGotoState or OnEventPushState and WildcardEvent . The following gives the precise semantics of these operations with regards to push and pop. First of all only one action per specific event type can be defined on a given State , so the following would be an error: [DeferEvents(typeof(E1), typeof(E2))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(E1), nameof(HandleE1))] class SomeState : State { } Because the E1 has both a DeferEvents and OnEventDoAction defined on the same state. Second, a pushed state inherits DeferEvents , IgnoreEvents , OnEventDoAction actions from all previous states on the active state stack, but it does not inherit OnEventGotoState or OnEventPushState actions. If multiple states on the stack of active states define an action for a specific event type then the action closest to the top of the stack takes precedence. For example: [DeferEvents(typeof(E1))] [OnEventPushState(typeof(E1), typeof(S2))] class A : State { } [OnEventDoAction(typeof(E1), nameof(HandleE1))] class B : State { } In state B the OnEventDoAction takes precedence over the inherited DeferEvents for event E1 . On a given state actions defined for a specific event type take precedence over actions involving WildcardEvent but a pushed state can override a specific event type action with a WildcardEvent action. If an event cannot be handled by a pushed state then that state is automatically popped so handling can be attempted again on the lower states. If this auto-popping pops all states then an unhandled event error is raised.","title":"State machines"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/state-machines/#state-machines","text":"A Coyote state machine is a special type of Actor that inherits from the StateMachine class which lives in the Microsoft.Coyote.Actors namespace.

In an Actor you would need to check this yourself and throw an exception, whereas in a state machine this is more declarative and is enforced by the Coyote runtime; the Coyote runtime will report an error if an event is received on a State of a StateMachine that was not expecting to receive that event. This reduces the amount of tedious book keeping code you need to write, and keeps your code even cleaner. For an example of a state machine in action see the state machine demo .","title":"State machines"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/state-machines/#goto-push-and-pop-states","text":"Besides RaiseEvent , state machine event handlers can request a state change in code rather than depending on OnEventGotoState attributes. This allows conditional goto operations as shown in the following example: void InitOnEntry() { if (this.Random()) { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Active>(); } else { this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Busy>(); } } State machines can also push and pop states, effectively creating a stack of active states. Use [OnEventPushState(...)] or RaisePushStateEvent in code to push a new state: this.RaisePushStateEvent<Active>(); This will push the Active state on the stack, but it will also inherit some actions declared on the Init state. The Active state can pop itself off the stack, returning to the Init state using a RaisePopStateEvent call: void HandlePing() { Console.WriteLine(\"Server received ping event while in the {0} state\", this.CurrentState.Name); this.RaisePopStateEvent(); // pop the current state off the stack of active states. } Note that this does not result in the OnEntry method being called again, because you never actually exited the Init state in this case. But if you used RaiseGotoStateEvent instead of RaisePushStateEvent and RaisePopStateEvent then InitOnEntry will be called again, and that would make our Server toggle back and forth between the Init and Active states. The push and pop feature is considered an advanced feature of state machines. It is designed to help you reuse some of your event handling code, where you can put \u201ccommon event handling\u201d in lower states and more specific event handling in pushed states.

Instead, the machine should skip over PingEvent and PongEvent (without dropping these events from the queue) and dequeue the next event that is not being deferred. Note that when a state decides to defer an event a subsequent pushed state can choose to receive that event if it wants to, but if the pushed state chooses not to receive the event then it is not an error and it remains deferred.

If nothing else happens, (no other actionable events are queued on this state machine) then the OnIdle method will be called over and over until something else changes. It is more efficient to use CreatePeriodicTimer for low priority work. Default events can also invoke goto, and push state transitions, which brings up an interesting case where you can actually implement an infinite ping pong using the following: internal class PingPongMachine : StateMachine { [Start] [OnEntry(nameof(OnPing))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(DefaultEvent), typeof(Pong))] public class Ping : State { } public void OnPing() { Console.WriteLine(\"OnPing\"); } [OnEntry(nameof(OnPong))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(DefaultEvent), typeof(Ping))] public class Pong : State { } void OnPong() { Console.WriteLine(\"OnPong\"); } } The difference between this and a timer based ping-pong is that this will run as fast as the Coyote runtime can go.

Second, a pushed state inherits DeferEvents , IgnoreEvents , OnEventDoAction actions from all previous states on the active state stack, but it does not inherit OnEventGotoState or OnEventPushState actions. If multiple states on the stack of active states define an action for a specific event type then the action closest to the top of the stack takes precedence.

On a given state actions defined for a specific event type take precedence over actions involving WildcardEvent but a pushed state can override a specific event type action with a WildcardEvent action. If an event cannot be handled by a pushed state then that state is automatically popped so handling can be attempted again on the lower states.

Synchronous execution of actors Coyote offers the following APIs (and overloads) for synchronous execution of actor creation and event sending. Task<ActorId> CreateActorAndExecuteAsync(Type type, Event e = null, Guid opGroupId = default); Task<bool> SendEventAndExecuteAsync(ActorId target, Event e, Guid opGroupId = default, SendOptions options = null); Both of these are async methods and must be awaited by the caller. The method CreateActorAndExecuteAsync when awaited, returns only when the newly created actor becomes idle. That is, it creates the actor, passes it the initial event e , starts executing the actor, and then waits for the actor to become idle. An actor is idle when no events can be received from its inbox. The method SendEventAndExecuteAsync when awaited has two possible executions. If the target actor is running (i.e., it is not idle) then the method only enqueues the event and returns immediately with the return value false . If the target actor was idle then the method enqueues the event (which causes the target actor to start executing) and waits until the actor becomes idle again. In this case, the method returns true indicating that the event has been processed by the target actor. Note that this is only one level deep. If the event handler invoked by the actor creation or event handling decides to send more events to other actors, then the above synchronous methods do not wait for that additional work to be completed, unless those events are sent to this.Id which does stop the actor from becoming idle. Another type of synchronous execution is provided by the Actor method ReceiveEventAsync . This method allows an actor to wait for a given type of event to be received, and can even provide a predicate that conditionally receives the event. This means instead of declaring an event handler like this which means you can receive this event any time and call HandlePoing: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(PongEvent), nameof(HandlePong))] You can instead explicitly receive the event in a specific place in your actor like this so that the event is not generally handled at other times: Event e = await this.ReceiveEventAsync(typeof(PongEvent)); HandlePong(e); A second overload of ReceiveEventAsync allows you to provide a list of event types each with their own predicates. This version of the method receives the first matching event. A ReceiveEventAsync call blocks all non-matching events from being dequeued from the actor\u2019s inbox. Potential deadlocks with ReceiveEventAsync You should be careful with the use of ReceiveEventAsync when using CreateActorAndExecuteAsync and SendEventAndExecuteAsync . In the absence of ReceiveEventAsync , the semantics of these methods guarantee that the program cannot deadlock. With a ReceiveEventAsync the following situation can occur. Let\u2019s suppose there are two actors A and B and the latter is idle. Then actor A does SendEventAndExecuteAsync to pass an event e to B . Because B was idle, A will wait until B becomes idle again. But if B executes a ReceiveEventAsync while processing the event e , expecting another event from A then the program deadlocks. (Blocking on a ReceiveEventAsync is not considered as being idle.) Extracting information from an actor Suppose there is a Coyote actor M1 that holds some information that you are interested in grabbing. The usual way of getting this information would be to SendEvent a \u201cget\u201d message to M1 and then wait for its response via ReceiveEventAsync . However, a ReceiveEventAsync can only be executed by an actor. How do you get the result outside the context of an actor, from, say, a static method? One option is to use these *AndExecuteAsync methods. First define a trampoline actor T that you create from your static method via CreateActorAndExecuteAsync . The trampoline actor, in its OnEntry method of the start state (which is called immediately when a actor is created), sends the \u201cget\u201d message to M1 and waits for its response via ReceiveEventAsync . Once it gets the response, it can stash the result in an object that can be safely shared with the calling static method without any race conditions. You can use a SharedRegister , which will rule out race conditions as well, but this still requires a separate protocol to know when the result has been made available. Running an actor synchronously Another programming pattern is to drive an actor synchronously. The program can do CreateActorAndExecuteAsync to create the actor, then repeatedly do SendEventAndExecuteAsync to make the actor process events one after another. Let\u2019s consider an example. Suppose that we need to define a actor M that is easily decomposed into two smaller actors M1 and M2 . For each incoming event, M decides to run one of the two actors; there is no need to run them in parallel. In this case, you only need to code up the smaller actors M1 and M2 . The actor M can be a simple wrapper. On instantiation, M creates the two child actors as follows: ActorId m1 = this.CreateActorAndExecuteAsync(typeof(M1), ...); ActorId m2 = this.CreateActorAndExecuteAsync(typeof(M2), ...); When M receives an event e , it will choose to run the appropriate actor as follows: if (SomeCondition(e)) { bool b1 = await this.SendEventAndExecuteAsync(m1, e); this.Assert(b1); } else { bool b2 = await this.SendEventAndExecuteAsync(m2, e); this.Assert(b2); } Note that the two assertions above are guaranteed to never fail because the m1 and m2 actors are always left in an idle state by M , provided that M never gives out the ActorId of m1 or m2 to any other actors and does not so long as M1 and M2 do not queue other events on themselves using SendEvent .","title":"Synchronous execution"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/synchronous-execution/#obsolete","text":"Note: these api\u2019s are now obsolete and it is recommended instead that you use the Event Group construct to track the asynchronous completion of operations across your actors.","title":"Obsolete"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/synchronous-execution/#synchronous-execution-of-actors","text":"Coyote offers the following APIs (and overloads) for synchronous execution of actor creation and event sending.

Timers are handy for modeling a common type of asynchronous behavior in distributed systems, so you can find more bugs in your code relating to how it deals with the uncertainty of various kinds of timeouts. Timers provide a once only timeout event or a periodic timeout, which can continually send such events on a user-defined interval until they are stopped. To make use of timers, you must include the Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.Timers namespace. You can start a non-periodic timer using the function StartTimer . TimerInfo StartTimer(TimeSpan startDelay, TimerElapsedEvent customEvent) StartTimer takes as argument: 1. TimeSpan startDelay , which is the amount of time to wait before sending the timeout event. 2. TimerElapsedEvent customEvent , an optional custom event (of a user-specified subclass of TimerElapsedEvent ) to raise instead of the default TimerElapsedEvent . StartTimer returns TimerInfo , which contains information about the created non-periodic timer. The non-periodic timer is automatically disposed after it timeouts. You can also pass the TimerInfo to the StopTimer method to manually stop and dispose the timer. The timer enqueues events of type TimerElapsedEvent (or of a user-specified subclass of TimerElapsedEvent ) in the inbox of the actor that created it. The TimerElapsedEvent contains as payload, the same TimerInfo returned during the timer creation. If you create multiple timers, then the TimerInfo object can be used to distinguish the sources of the different TimerElapsedEvent events. You can start a periodic timer using the function StartPeriodicTimer . TimerInfo StartPeriodicTimer(TimeSpan startDelay, TimeSpan period, TimerElapsedEvent customEvent) StartPeriodicTimer takes as argument: 1. TimeSpan startDelay , which is the amount of time to wait before sending the first timeout event. 2. TimeSpan period , which is the time interval between timeout events. 3. TimerElapsedEvent customEvent , an optional custom event (of a user-specified subclass of TimerElapsedEvent ) to raise instead of the default TimerElapsedEvent . Periodic timers work similarly to normal timers, however you need to manually stop a periodic timer using the StopTimer method if you want it to stop sending TimerElapsedEvent events. Note that when an actor halts , it automatically stops and disposes all its periodic and non-periodic timers. A sample which demonstrates the use of such timers is provided in the Timers Sample on github, which is explained in detail below. First you need to declare on your Actor that it is expecting to receive the TimerElapsedEvent so the class is defined like this: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(TimerElapsedEvent), nameof(HandleTimeout))] internal class Client : Actor { ... } To kick things off the initialization method starts a non-periodic timer: protected override Task OnInitializeAsync(Event initialEvent) { Console.WriteLine(\"<Client> Starting a non-periodic timer\"); this.StartTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)); return base.OnInitializeAsync(initialEvent); } The HandleTimeout method then receives this timeout and starts a periodic timer as follows: private void HandleTimeout(Event e) { TimerElapsedEvent te = (TimerElapsedEvent)e; this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Handling timeout from timer\"); this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Starting a period timer\"); this.PeriodicTimer = this.StartPeriodicTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), new CustomTimerEvent()); } In this case we use a CustomTimerEvent instead of the default TimerElapsedEvent , this custom event is defined as follows: internal class CustomTimerEvent : TimerElapsedEvent { /// <summary> /// Count of timeout events processed. /// </summary> internal int Count; } This custom event makes it possible to route the period timeouts to a different handler using this on the actor class: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(CustomTimerEvent), nameof(HandlePeriodicTimeout))] In the HandlePeriodicTimeout method we count the number of timeouts and stop when we reach 3: private void HandlePeriodicTimeout(Event e) { this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer\"); if (e is CustomTimerEvent ce) { ce.Count++; if (ce.Count == 3) { this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Stopping the periodic timer\"); this.StopTimer(this.PeriodicTimer); } } } Notice how we can cast the Event into our custom CustomTimerEvent , and we get the same instance of CustomTimerEvent on each period call, so this way the CustomTimerEvent can contain useful state, in this case the Count . The output of this program is as follows: <Client> Starting a non-periodic timer <Client> Handling timeout from timer <Client> Starting a period timer <Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer <Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer <Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer <Client> Stopping the periodic timer Implementation notes Note that timers are implemented differently depending on what mode your program is running in. Normal \u201cproduction\u201d mode execution uses an optimized timer built on System.Threading.Timer . Timers that run during systematic testing, however, are quite different and are implemented in a MockTimerActor class. This mock actually removes all concept of real time intervals, and replaces that with a random decision to timeout or not to timeout. This makes your test run much faster. But it can also make your test see a lot more timeout events that you may be expecting. This is good for finding bugs, but can overwhelm the test with timeout events. To reduce the number of timeouts there is a --timeout-delay command line option on the coyote test tool. This timeout delay is given to the mock timer and it will only fire a timeout when RandomInteger(delay) == 0 . The default value of --timeout-delay is 10, which means timeouts only fire once every 10 times the timer gets scheduled by the systematic testing runtime. This turns out to be a pretty good default that stops your test from getting too overwhelmed by timeout events, but if you still see too many timeout events in your test logs, then you can increase this number.","title":"Using timers in actors"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/timers/#using-timers-in-actors","text":"The Coyote actor programming model has built-in support for timers.

First you need to declare on your Actor that it is expecting to receive the TimerElapsedEvent so the class is defined like this: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(TimerElapsedEvent), nameof(HandleTimeout))] internal class Client : Actor { ... } To kick things off the initialization method starts a non-periodic timer: protected override Task OnInitializeAsync(Event initialEvent) { Console.WriteLine(\"<Client> Starting a non-periodic timer\"); this.StartTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)); return base.OnInitializeAsync(initialEvent); } The HandleTimeout method then receives this timeout and starts a periodic timer as follows: private void HandleTimeout(Event e) { TimerElapsedEvent te = (TimerElapsedEvent)e; this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Handling timeout from timer\"); this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Starting a period timer\"); this.PeriodicTimer = this.StartPeriodicTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), new CustomTimerEvent()); } In this case we use a CustomTimerEvent instead of the default TimerElapsedEvent , this custom event is defined as follows: internal class CustomTimerEvent : TimerElapsedEvent { /// <summary> /// Count of timeout events processed. /// </summary> internal int Count; } This custom event makes it possible to route the period timeouts to a different handler using this on the actor class: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(CustomTimerEvent), nameof(HandlePeriodicTimeout))] In the HandlePeriodicTimeout method we count the number of timeouts and stop when we reach 3: private void HandlePeriodicTimeout(Event e) { this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer\"); if (e is CustomTimerEvent ce) { ce.Count++; if (ce.Count == 3) { this.WriteMessage(\"<Client> Stopping the periodic timer\"); this.StopTimer(this.PeriodicTimer); } } } Notice how we can cast the Event into our custom CustomTimerEvent , and we get the same instance of CustomTimerEvent on each period call, so this way the CustomTimerEvent can contain useful state, in this case the Count . The output of this program is as follows: <Client> Starting a non-periodic timer <Client> Handling timeout from timer <Client> Starting a period timer <Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer <Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer <Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer <Client> Stopping the periodic timer","title":"Using timers in actors"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/timers/#implementation-notes","text":"Note that timers are implemented differently depending on what mode your program is running in. Normal \u201cproduction\u201d mode execution uses an optimized timer built on System.Threading.Timer . Timers that run during systematic testing, however, are quite different and are implemented in a MockTimerActor class. This mock actually removes all concept of real time intervals, and replaces that with a random decision to timeout or not to timeout. This makes your test run much faster. But it can also make your test see a lot more timeout events that you may be expecting. This is good for finding bugs, but can overwhelm the test with timeout events. To reduce the number of timeouts there is a --timeout-delay command line option on the coyote test tool. This timeout delay is given to the mock timer and it will only fire a timeout when RandomInteger(delay) == 0 . The default value of --timeout-delay is 10, which means timeouts only fire once every 10 times the timer gets scheduled by the systematic testing runtime. This turns out to be a pretty good default that stops your test from getting too overwhelmed by timeout events, but if you still see too many timeout events in your test logs, then you can increase this number.","title":"Implementation notes"},{"location":"programming-models/actors/uncaught-exceptions/","text":"Semantics of unhandled exceptions Coyote Actors can execute arbitrary C# code in their event handlers. This page discusses what happens if such code throws an exception that is not handled inside the action itself. As is usual in asynchronous programming , one should be careful with unhandled exceptions. In test mode (i.e., when running a test with coyote test ... ), all unhandled exceptions are an error and the test will fail. The coyote tester will stop the execution at that point and report an error. In production mode (i.e., when running a Coyote program outside of coyote test ), the Coyote runtime intercepts any unhandled exception in an actor. The exception is then delivered to the OnFailure delegate of the runtime. At this point, it is your responsibility to take the appropriate action. For instance, you can cause the program to crash and create a dump (for debugging later) as follows: runtime.OnFailure += delegate (Exception exception) { Environment.FailFast(exception.ToString(), exception); }; It is important that you induce a crash to stop the program, after perhaps taking some cleanup actions. If you don\u2019t do so, the runtime automatically enters a \u201cfailure\u201d mode. Actors may continue running their current action, but no additional work will take place. The runtime stops all Enqueue and Dequeue operations in the program. Thus, messages sent will not be delivered, and already-received messages will not be dequeued.

During systematic testing, AsyncLock is controlled by coyote test to explore acquire/release interleavings and find concurrency bugs. Why is an asynchronous lock necessary? Although it is recommended that asynchronous code should be as lock-free as possible, in some scenarios it is still useful to serialize asynchronous access to a shared resource. Using the C# lock statement might not be an option as C# forbids the use of await inside the lock scope. This is because using await inside lock (which is implemented using System.Threading.Monitor APIs) can be prone to deadlocks due to its reentrancy semantics. The Coyote AsyncLock type does not have this limitation, and a controlled Task is free to await while holding an instance of this lock type. Awaiting on an AsyncLock also does not block the underlying thread allowing for a more efficient execution. Note that the C# lock statement is still supported by coyote test . However\u2014besides not using await in the body of lock \u2014you should also make sure to not call any Coyote API that can introduce a scheduling decision during systematic testing (such as Task.Run , Task.Delay or Task.Yield ), while holding a lock , as this can lead to deadlocks. How do you use it? You create an instance of an AsyncLock by calling the static method AsyncLock.Create() . The only instance-level method that AsyncLock provides is AcquireAsync() . This method tries to acquire the lock asynchronously, and returns a task that completes when the lock has been acquired. The returned task\u2019s result is of type AsyncLock.Releaser . This Releaser implements the IDisposable interface. It releases the lock when disposed. Note that AcquireAsync() is not a reentrant operation. AsyncLock exposes the IsAcquired boolean property, which is true if the lock has been acquired, else false. Finally, when the AsyncLock is acquired, your code can enter the scope of this lock and perform synchronized operations. As the Releaser implements IDisposable , this makes it possible (and convenient) to put the synchronized code inside a using statement. This ensures the AsyncLock is released when exiting the body of using in a way that is also exception safe. During systematic testing, coyote test injects scheduling points upon acquiring or releasing the lock, which allows it to explore interleavings and expose bugs (including deadlocks). Example usage The code below demonstrates AsyncLock in action: using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; public class LockExample { private int Value = 0; private bool IsRunning = false; private readonly AsyncLock Mutex = AsyncLock.Create(); public async Task FirstOperationAsync() { using (await this.Mutex.AcquireAsync()) { if (!this.IsRunning) { this.IsRunning = true; this.Value = 5; } } } public async Task SecondOperationAsync(bool reenter) { using (await this.Mutex.AcquireAsync()) { if (this.IsRunning) { this.IsRunning = false; this.Value = 0; } if (reenter) { // This causes a deadlock ... so don't do this! await this.SecondOperationAsync(reenter); } } } } In the above example, the FirstOperationAsync and SecondOperationAsync methods use an AsyncLock to avoid a race condition while testing and updating IsRunning and Value . You can write a test for this code as follows: using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; public static class Program { public static async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Main() { await RunTestAsync(); } [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static async Task RunTestAsync() { bool reenter = false; LockExample test = new LockExample(); for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { var task1 = test.FirstOperationAsync(); var task2 = test.SecondOperationAsync(reenter); await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2); } Console.WriteLine(\"Done testing.\"); } } When you run this test in the command line (by running the executable on its own, without coyote test ), then it normally finishes with the following output: Done testing. Next, change bool reenter = false; to true , build and run the test again (without coyote test ). This time execution is hanging forever and needs to be killed by pressing Ctrl-C. So, what happened? As you see from the code above, the SecondOperationAsync can invoke itself while holding AsyncLock when reenter is true. This results in a deadlock. Now, try to run the test with coyote test .

Typically, this should not be needed: the \u201cControlled\u201d APIs provided by Coyote cover a lot of scenarios already. However, if you find yourself working with code that may potentially have data races, or you are modeling other forms of synchronization not covered by Coyote already, then you might have to help out the tester a bit more. During systematic testing , Coyote serializes the concurrent execution of a program. Serialization means that only one task is running at any given time. This helps remove the randomness that happens when the operating system schedules parallel tasks and performs thread switching at unpredictable moments depending on your machine load. It also makes executions reproducible because Coyote controls the scheduling. This is super useful for debugging. Coyote, however, does not cover all possible interleavings by default. The interleavings are complete (i.e., all possible behaviors can be covered by testing, given enough time) for race-free programs. For programs with racy accesses, you have to help Coyote find more interleavings. Consider the following code: int x = 0; async Task A() { var a = ++x; Console.WriteLine(\"A: \" + a); await Task.CompletedTask; } async Task B() { var b = ++x; Console.WriteLine(\"B: \" + b); await Task.CompletedTask; } Task.Run(A); Task.Run(B); This code is setting up an obvious race condition on the variable x . The production output of this program can print A: 1, B: 2 or A: 2, B: 1 and sometimes even A: 1, B: 1 . This is because the x++ operator is not atomic, a thread switch can happen after the read of the value of x and before the store of the incremented value. When running the above code under coyote test , the output will always be A: 1, B: 2 or A: 2, B:1 . This is because coyote test runs the tasks A and B until they either hit a scheduling point or naturally terminate. None of the statements in either methods is an automatically instrumented scheduling point, so Coyote fails to test the data-race related concurrency above. The coyote test tool executes tasks up to a scheduling point , and only then chooses to switch to another task (or keeps running the same one) and execute it up to the next scheduling point and so on. The default scheduling points are at Task API granularity (e.g., Task.Run , Task.Delay , await or Task.WhenAny etc.). This is why the racy-behavior A: 1, B: 1 is missed in the above example: there is no scheduling point between the load of x and the store of its incremented value. Instrumenting scheduling points to exercise racy behaviors It is generally not safe for multiple tasks to perform non-atomic operations on the same variable at the same time as this can create data race conditions. Ideally, you should avoid races using synchronization. You can use a Semaphore , for instance, to protect the increment of x . This rules out the A: 1, B: 1 behavior and also makes coyote testing complete (given enough time). There may be situations where you cannot avoid the races, for instance when writing mocks for testing. In that case, use Task.ExploreContextSwitch to introduce a custom scheduling point and help coyote tester find sneaky bugs due to subtle data races within your code. You can test this concurrency by introducing an explicit scheduling point using Task.ExploreContextSwitch : int x = 0; int a = 0; int b = 0; async Task A() { a = x + 1; Task.ExploreContextSwitch(); x = a; } async Task B() { b = x + 1; Task.ExploreContextSwitch(); x = b; } public void RunTest() { var t1 = Task.Run(A); var t2 = Task.Run(B); Task.WaitAll(t1, t2); Specification.Assert(a > 1 || b > 1, string.Format(\"a = {0} and b = {1}\", a, b)); } When you run this with coyote test the specification will sometimes fail with the Assert <ErrorLog> A: 1, B: 1 , which means coyote test can now fully explore behaviors of this program. Note that Task.ExploreContextSwitch has no effect in production code, it only affects code running under coyote test . Expressing asynchronous behavior in mocks Mocks often don\u2019t have true asynchrony (they might just be dummy in-memory calls). In order to force asynchronous execution when calling such mocks, you need to introduce a scheduling point in them. One great way to do that is by using Task.Yield . This method, similar to Task.Run , has the following two properties: 1) As it\u2019s a scheduling point, it suspends the currently executing task and gives control back to Coyote so it can decide which task to schedule next. 2) Task.Yield introduces a source of asynchrony in the system. The caller of the method that yields and the code after the yield can run asynchronously with respect to each other. Similar to Task.Run , Coyote automatically instruments a scheduling point each time Task.Yield is called. The following example illustrates the difference between Task.Yield and Task.ExploreContextSwitch . Consider two methods FooAsync and BarAsync , where the user calls FooAsync which in turn calls BarAsync . async Task BarAsync() { await Task.Yield(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Bar!\"); } async Task FooAsync() { BarAsync(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Foo!\"); await Task.CompletedTask; } If you call FooAsync above, then due to the asynchrony introduced by Task.Yield , there are two possible outputs printed: I am Foo! I am Bar! or I am Bar! I am Foo! If you now replace Task.Yield with Task.ExploreContextSwitch , as in the following example: async Task BarAsync() { Task.ExploreContextSwitch(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Bar!\"); await Task.CompletedTask; } async Task FooAsync() { BarAsync(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Foo!\"); await Task.CompletedTask; } Then, you only get one possible output: I am Bar! I am Foo! This is because when you hit Task.ExploreContextSwitch , the control goes back to Coyote and it looks to schedule another task, but since there is only one task in the set of enabled tasks, it is forced to schedule the same task again, which prints I am Bar! and then ends up printing I am Foo! . The reason there is only a single task in the above example, is because the await Task.CompletedTask statements in BarAsync and FooAsync always run synchronously (the task is already completed after all). Invoking Task.ExploreContextSwitch does not alter execution semantics, so by itself cannot introduce concurrency where there is none.","title":"Improving coverage of fine-grained interleavings"},{"location":"programming-models/async/interleavings/#helping-coyote-cover-fine-grained-interleavings","text":"This page covers an advanaced topic of programmtically controlling the interleavings that Coyote covers during testing.

In order to force asynchronous execution when calling such mocks, you need to introduce a scheduling point in them. One great way to do that is by using Task.Yield . This method, similar to Task.Run , has the following two properties: 1) As it\u2019s a scheduling point, it suspends the currently executing task and gives control back to Coyote so it can decide which task to schedule next. 2) Task.Yield introduces a source of asynchrony in the system. The caller of the method that yields and the code after the yield can run asynchronously with respect to each other. Similar to Task.Run , Coyote automatically instruments a scheduling point each time Task.Yield is called. The following example illustrates the difference between Task.Yield and Task.ExploreContextSwitch . Consider two methods FooAsync and BarAsync , where the user calls FooAsync which in turn calls BarAsync . async Task BarAsync() { await Task.Yield(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Bar!\"); } async Task FooAsync() { BarAsync(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Foo!\"); await Task.CompletedTask; } If you call FooAsync above, then due to the asynchrony introduced by Task.Yield , there are two possible outputs printed: I am Foo! I am Bar! or I am Bar! I am Foo! If you now replace Task.Yield with Task.ExploreContextSwitch , as in the following example: async Task BarAsync() { Task.ExploreContextSwitch(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Bar!\"); await Task.CompletedTask; } async Task FooAsync() { BarAsync(); Console.WriteLine(\"I am Foo!\"); await Task.CompletedTask; } Then, you only get one possible output: I am Bar! I am Foo! This is because when you hit Task.ExploreContextSwitch , the control goes back to Coyote and it looks to schedule another task, but since there is only one task in the set of enabled tasks, it is forced to schedule the same task again, which prints I am Bar! and then ends up printing I am Foo! . The reason there is only a single task in the above example, is because the await Task.CompletedTask statements in BarAsync and FooAsync always run synchronously (the task is already completed after all). Invoking Task.ExploreContextSwitch does not alter execution semantics, so by itself cannot introduce concurrency where there is none.","title":"Expressing asynchronous behavior in mocks"},{"location":"programming-models/async/overview/","text":"Programming model: asynchronous tasks The asynchronous tasks programming model of Coyote is based on the task-based asynchronous pattern . Coyote provides a drop in replacement for the native .NET Task type that works with the async and await C# keywords . To avoid confusion we will use the following terminology: Short Name Fully Qualified Name native Task System.Threading.Tasks.Task controlled Task Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks.Task A controlled Task is similar to a native Task type and can be used alongside the native Task type to easily invoke external asynchronous APIs from your code. We will discuss this in more detail below. The benefit of using the controlled Task is that the Coyote runtime takes control of its execution and scheduling during systematic testing, enabling coyote test to explore various interleavings between controlled Task objects. In production, a controlled Task executes efficiently, as it a simple wrapper over a native Task , with operations being pass-through (Coyote takes control only during testing). Overview The core of the Coyote asynchronous tasks programming model is the controlled Task and Task<T> objects, which model asynchronous operations. They are supported by the async and await keywords. This programming model is fairly simple in most cases: - For I/O-bound code, you await an operation which returns a controlled Task or Task<T> inside of an async method. - For CPU-bound code, you await an operation which is started on a background thread with the Task.Run method. In more detail, a controlled Task is a construct used to implement what is known as the promise model of concurrency . A controlled Task basically offers you a promise that work will be completed at a later point, letting you coordinate with this promise using async and await . A controlled Task represents a single operation which does not return a value. A controlled Task<T> represents a single operation which returns a value of type T . It is important to reason about tasks as abstractions of work happening asynchronously, and not an abstraction over threading. By default, a controlled Task executes (using a Task ) on the current thread and delegates work to the operating system, as appropriate. Optionally, a controlled Task can be explicitly requested to run on a separate thread via the Task.Run API. The await keyword is where the magic happens. Using await yields control to the caller of the method that performed await , allowing your program to be responsive or a service to be elastic, since it can now perform useful work while a controlled Task is running on the background. Your code does not need to rely on callbacks or events to continue execution after the task has been completed. The C# language does that for you. If you\u2019re using controlled Task<T> , the await keyword will additionally unwrap the value returned when the controlled Task is complete. The details of how await works are further explained in the C# docs . During testing, using await allows the Coyote runtime to automatically inject scheduling points and thoroughly explore asynchronous interleavings to find concurrency bugs. You can choose to use the Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks.Task directly in your programs or you can use the automatic rewriting feature which will rewrite your compiled binaries that use System.Threading.Tasks.Task and inject the required Coyote controls so you can run coyote test on the rewritten binaries. What happens under the covers The C# compiler transforms an async method into a state machine (literally called IAsyncStateMachine) which keeps track of things like yielding execution when an await is reached and resuming execution when a background job has finished. The controlled Task type uses a C# 7 feature known as async task types (see here ) that allows framework developers to create custom task types that can be used with async and await . This is where the magic happens. In production, controlled Task enables C# to build a custom asynchronous state machine that uses regular Task objects. However, during testing, Coyote uses dependency injection to supply a custom asynchronous state machine that allows controlling the scheduling of controlled Task objects, and thus systematically exploring their interleavings. How to use asynchronous tasks We will now show how to write a program using the Coyote asynchronous task programming model. As mentioned before, the controlled Task type is a drop-in replacement for the Task type, and thus any prior experience writing asynchronous code using async and await is useful and relevant. If you are not already familiar with async and await , you can learn more in the C# docs . Say that you have the following simple C# program: // Use the Coyote controlled task type. using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; using Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications; public class Program { public int Value = 0; public async Task WriteWithDelayAsync(int value) { await Task.Delay(100); this.Value = value; } public async Task RunAsync() { Task task1 = WriteWithDelayAsync(3); Task task2 = WriteWithDelayAsync(5); await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2); Specification.Assert(this.Value == 5, \"Value is '{0}' instead of 5.\", this.Value); } } The above program contains a int Value that is updated by the WriteWithDelayAsync method. This is a C# async method that asynchronously waits for a controlled Task to complete after 100 ms (created via the Task.Delay(100) call), and then modifies the Value field. The asynchronous RunAsync method twice invokes the WriteWithDelayAsync method by passing the values 3 and 5 respectively. Each method call returns a controlled Task object, which can be awaited using await . The RunAsync method first invokes the two asynchronous method calls and then calls Task.WhenAll(...) to await on the completion of both tasks. Because WriteWithDelayAsync method awaits a Task.Delay to complete, it will yield control to the caller of the method, which is the RunAsync method. However, the RunAsync method is not awaiting immediately upon invoking the WriteWithDelayAsync method calls. This means that the two calls can happen asynchronously , and thus the resulting Value can be either 3 or 5 after Task.WhenAll(...) completes. Using Specification.Assert , Coyote allows you to write assertions that check these kinds of safety properties. In this case, the assertion will check if the Value is 5 or not, and if not it will throw an exception, or report an error together with a reproducible trace during testing. What about System.Collections.Concurrent? Yes, you can use the .NET thread safe collections to share information across tasks, but not the BlockingCollection as this can block and Coyote will not know about that which will lead to deadlocks during testing. The other thread safe collections do not have uncontrolled non-determinism, either from Task.Run, or from retry loops, timers or waits. The caveat is that Coyote has not instrumented the .NET concurrent collections, and so coyote does not systematically explore thread switching in the middle of these operations, therefore Coyote will not always find all data race conditions related to concurrent access on these collections. For example, two tasks calling TryAdd with the same key, one task will succeed the other will not, but Coyote will not systematically explore all possible orderings around this operation. You can help Coyote do better by using ExploreContextSwitch .

During testing, the semaphore is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version so that Coyote can perform any desired scheduling and interleaving of asynchronous operations. Why is a semaphore necessary? A semaphore is used in scenarios where you have to limit the number of tasks that can use a resource simultaneously. There are two semaphore types provided in C#: Semaphore and SemaphoreSlim . However, you should not use these .NET semaphore types in a Coyote program because, as discussed in the Testing Requirements , synchronization must be done via Coyote APIs. Using the controlled Semaphore type of Coyote allows coyote test to fully control the scheduling of asynchronous operations. How do you use it? You create an instance of a Semaphore by calling the static method Semaphore.Create(initialCount, maxCount) . This method requires you to specify two Int32 arguments: initialCount . The initial number of requests for the semaphore that can be granted concurrently. maxCount . The maximum number of requests for the semaphore that can be granted concurrently. The following relation should hold between the values of these arguments: 0 <= initialCount <= maxCount && maxCount > 0 If this is violated, Semaphore.Create(initialCount, maxCount) throws an exception in production mode or reports a test bug when run under coyote test. You can enter the so created semaphore by executing either of its void Wait() or Task WaitAsync() methods: The Wait() method blocks the task until it can enter the Semaphore . The WaitAsync() method returns a task that will complete when the semaphore has been entered. The CurrentCount property has as its value the current count of requests that can be granted. The Release() method. When you are done with handling the resource, you must exit the semaphore by invoking this method. Not releasing the granted access and staying inside the semaphore forever is a bug in your code that limits the capacity of the semaphore and if this bug happens repeatedly with other tasks, can lead to the semaphore getting full and permanently unavailable for use. Another possible error is to perform a Release() more times than the maxCount of a semaphore. This results in an exception (in production mode) and in a test bug when testing with Coyote. The Dispose() method. A Semaphore implements the IDisposable interface. Finally, when your code no longer needs the semaphore object you should dispose it using this method. Then it is a good practice to dispose of this Semaphore object, invoking this method. Example usage The code below demonstrates Semaphore in action: ```c# using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; public class SemaphoreExample { private readonly Semaphore TheSemaphore; private int ProtectedValue = 0; private readonly int MaxCount; public SemaphoreExample(int initialCurrentCount, int maxCount) { this.MaxCount = maxCount; this.TheSemaphore = Semaphore.Create(initialCurrentCount, maxCount); } public async Task RunTask(string taskName, int sleepMilliseconds, int newValue) { this.WriteLine($\"{taskName}: About to enter the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: {this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount}\"); await this.TheSemaphore.WaitAsync(); this.WriteLine($\"{taskName}: Entered the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: {this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount}\"); await Task.Delay(sleepMilliseconds); this.ProtectedValue = newValue; this.WriteLine($\"{taskName}: Waited {sleepMilliseconds}ms. Now exiting the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: {this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount}\"); this.TheSemaphore.Release(); this.WriteLine($\"{taskName}: Exited the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: {this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount}\"); this.WriteLine($\"{taskName}: this.ProtectedValue: {this.ProtectedValue}\"); this.WriteLine(\"=====================================================================\\n\"); } public async Task RunTask2(string taskName) { var semaphoreCount = this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount; Console.WriteLine($\"{taskName} starting. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: {semaphoreCount}\"); for (var i = 1; i <= semaphoreCount + 1; i++) { Console.WriteLine($\"{taskName}: ({i}) Entering the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: {this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount}\"); await this.TheSemaphore.WaitAsync(); } } private void WriteLine(string msg) { string indent = new string(' ', (this.MaxCount - this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount) * 2); Console.Write(indent); Console.WriteLine(msg); } } ``` In the above example, the RunTask and RunTask2 methods use a Semaphore that allows only maxCount tasks to perform simultaneously inside the semaphore. The code below implements 2 test scenarios, and in the first of them invokes RunTask() to create 3 different tasks using the semaphore, specifying for the semaphore initialCount = 2, and maxCount = 2. using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; public static class Program { public static int Scenario = 1; public static void Main() { RunTest(); } [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void RunTest() { switch (Scenario) { case 1: SemaphoreExample test1 = new SemaphoreExample(2, 2); var task1 = test1.RunTask(\"Task1\", 500, 1); var task2 = test1.RunTask(\"Task2\", 1000, 2); var task3 = test1.RunTask(\"Task3\", 1000, 3); Task.WaitAll(task1, task2, task3); Console.WriteLine(\"test complete\"); break; case 2: SemaphoreExample test2 = new SemaphoreExample(2, 2); var task4 = test2.RunTask2(\"Task4\"); Task.WaitAny(task4); break; } } } In the first scenario ( Scenario == 1 ) the method RunTask() is invoked 3 times and creates 3 tasks that run asynchronously, then the code awaits the completion of all three tasks. The first two tasks enter the semaphore and fill its capacity completely as its maxCount is 2. Inside the semaphore, task1 awaits for 500 milliseconds, then sets this.ProtectedValue = 1 and releases (exits) the semaphore. task2 is also inside the semaphore with task1 but it waits for 1000 milliseconds, thus it has to wait about 500 milliseconds more after task1 exits the semaphore. Exactly when task1 exits the semaphore, its current count is increased from 0 to 1 and this allows the third task, task3 waiting for semaphore to be granted access. Having entered the semaphore, task3 waits for 1000 milliseconds. The other occupant of the semaphore ( task2 ) needs to wait only about 500ms more, then it sets this.ProtectedValue = 2 and releases (exits) the semaphore. Thus for the remaining about 500 milliseconds task3 is waiting as the sole occupant of the semaphore. Then it finally sets this.ProtectedValue = 3 and releases (exits) the semaphore. When you build and run the sample, the expected output is produced: Task1: About to enter the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task1: Entered the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task2: About to enter the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task2: Entered the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task3: About to enter the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task1: Waited 500ms. Now exiting the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task1: Exited the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task1: this.ProtectedValue: 1 Task3: Entered the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 ===================================================================== Task2: Waited 1000ms. Now exiting the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task2: Exited the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task2: this.ProtectedValue: 2 ===================================================================== Task3: Waited 1000ms. Now exiting the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task3: Exited the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task3: this.ProtectedValue: 3 ===================================================================== Now, run the example with coyote test . The testing completes normally, without finding any test bugs. You will get output from the coyote test tool, similar to this: ... Testing statistics: ..... Found 0 bugs. ... Scheduling statistics: ..... Explored 2000 schedules: 2000 fair and 0 unfair. In the second scenario ( Scenario == 2 ) a new SemaphoreExample instance is created with initialCurrentCount and maxCount having the same value 2. Then a single method ( RunTask2 ) is invoked and the task it returns is awaited upon. Remarkably, the code of this task tries to enter the semaphore more times than its CurrentCount and this must end abnormally. In the sample, change this line: public static int Scenario = 1; to: public static int Scenario = 2; Then build and run. The execution hangs, you have to kill the program with Ctrl-C, and you see this output: Task4 starting. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task4: (1) Entering the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task4: (2) Entering the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task4: (3) Entering the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Now, run the sample with coyote test . This time there is no hanging and Coyote quickly finds and reports a test bug: ... Task 0 found a bug. ... Emitting task 0 traces: ..... Writing ...\\Semaphores_0_2.txt ..... Writing ...\\Semaphores_0_2.schedule ... Elapsed 0.1125501 sec. Looking into the error file Semaphores_0_2.txt reveals this error message: <ErrorLog> Deadlock detected.

Then it is a good practice to dispose of this Semaphore object, invoking this method.","title":"How do you use it?"},{"location":"programming-models/async/semaphore/#example-usage","text":"The code below demonstrates Semaphore in action: ```c# using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; public class SemaphoreExample { private readonly Semaphore TheSemaphore; private int ProtectedValue = 0; private readonly int MaxCount; public SemaphoreExample(int initialCurrentCount, int maxCount) { this.MaxCount = maxCount; this.TheSemaphore = Semaphore.Create(initialCurrentCount, maxCount); } public async Task RunTask(string taskName, int sleepMilliseconds, int newValue) { this.WriteLine($\"{taskName}: About to enter the semaphore.

TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: {this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount}\"); await this.TheSemaphore.WaitAsync(); } } private void WriteLine(string msg) { string indent = new string(' ', (this.MaxCount - this.TheSemaphore.CurrentCount) * 2); Console.Write(indent); Console.WriteLine(msg); } } ``` In the above example, the RunTask and RunTask2 methods use a Semaphore that allows only maxCount tasks to perform simultaneously inside the semaphore. The code below implements 2 test scenarios, and in the first of them invokes RunTask() to create 3 different tasks using the semaphore, specifying for the semaphore initialCount = 2, and maxCount = 2. using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; public static class Program { public static int Scenario = 1; public static void Main() { RunTest(); } [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void RunTest() { switch (Scenario) { case 1: SemaphoreExample test1 = new SemaphoreExample(2, 2); var task1 = test1.RunTask(\"Task1\", 500, 1); var task2 = test1.RunTask(\"Task2\", 1000, 2); var task3 = test1.RunTask(\"Task3\", 1000, 3); Task.WaitAll(task1, task2, task3); Console.WriteLine(\"test complete\"); break; case 2: SemaphoreExample test2 = new SemaphoreExample(2, 2); var task4 = test2.RunTask2(\"Task4\"); Task.WaitAny(task4); break; } } } In the first scenario ( Scenario == 1 ) the method RunTask() is invoked 3 times and creates 3 tasks that run asynchronously, then the code awaits the completion of all three tasks. The first two tasks enter the semaphore and fill its capacity completely as its maxCount is 2. Inside the semaphore, task1 awaits for 500 milliseconds, then sets this.ProtectedValue = 1 and releases (exits) the semaphore. task2 is also inside the semaphore with task1 but it waits for 1000 milliseconds, thus it has to wait about 500 milliseconds more after task1 exits the semaphore. Exactly when task1 exits the semaphore, its current count is increased from 0 to 1 and this allows the third task, task3 waiting for semaphore to be granted access. Having entered the semaphore, task3 waits for 1000 milliseconds. The other occupant of the semaphore ( task2 ) needs to wait only about 500ms more, then it sets this.ProtectedValue = 2 and releases (exits) the semaphore. Thus for the remaining about 500 milliseconds task3 is waiting as the sole occupant of the semaphore. Then it finally sets this.ProtectedValue = 3 and releases (exits) the semaphore. When you build and run the sample, the expected output is produced: Task1: About to enter the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task1: Entered the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task2: About to enter the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task2: Entered the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task3: About to enter the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task1: Waited 500ms. Now exiting the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task1: Exited the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task1: this.ProtectedValue: 1 Task3: Entered the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 ===================================================================== Task2: Waited 1000ms. Now exiting the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Task2: Exited the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task2: this.ProtectedValue: 2 ===================================================================== Task3: Waited 1000ms. Now exiting the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task3: Exited the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task3: this.ProtectedValue: 3 ===================================================================== Now, run the example with coyote test . The testing completes normally, without finding any test bugs. You will get output from the coyote test tool, similar to this: ... Testing statistics: ..... Found 0 bugs. ... Scheduling statistics: ..... Explored 2000 schedules: 2000 fair and 0 unfair. In the second scenario ( Scenario == 2 ) a new SemaphoreExample instance is created with initialCurrentCount and maxCount having the same value 2. Then a single method ( RunTask2 ) is invoked and the task it returns is awaited upon. Remarkably, the code of this task tries to enter the semaphore more times than its CurrentCount and this must end abnormally. In the sample, change this line: public static int Scenario = 1; to: public static int Scenario = 2; Then build and run. The execution hangs, you have to kill the program with Ctrl-C, and you see this output: Task4 starting. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task4: (1) Entering the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 2 Task4: (2) Entering the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 1 Task4: (3) Entering the semaphore. TheSemaphore.CurrentCount: 0 Now, run the sample with coyote test . This time there is no hanging and Coyote quickly finds and reports a test bug: ... Task 0 found a bug. ... Emitting task 0 traces: ..... Writing ...\\Semaphores_0_2.txt .....

In production this construct is a thin wrapper on System.Threading.Monitor , and during testing, the SynchronizedBlock is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version so that Coyote can explore the scheduling and interleaving of asynchronous operations that are synchronized this way. Why is a synchronized block necessary? C# provides a built in lock keyword that uses System.Threading.Monitor under the covers. This keyword is often used to protect local state from data race conditions like this: class Foo { int count; object syncObject = new object(); public int Increment() { lock(syncObject) { return ++count; } } } The ++operator is not atomic, and therefore it is not thread safe, so the lock statement ensures that it becomes an atomic operation and so now the Increment method can be safely used in parallel situations. For added convenience, this lock statement is also re-entrant, so your class can call another method that also enters the lock and this is fine. This makes it easier to manage code reuse within your class. The Monitor class also has a very useful feature in the Wait and Pulse and PulseAll methods that is hard to replace with anything else. In this case one task can Wait while it is inside the lock for another task to signal it using Pulse . The Wait call releases the lock so another task can get the lock and call Pulse , when the lock is released, the waiting task can proceed as it now has the lock. These primitives form the core of very useful \u201csynchronization\u201d logic. Note that it is very important to also point out that C# does not allow await keyword to be used inside a lock statement as this can lead to deadlocks. How do you use it? Coyote provides a drop in replacement for System.Threading.Monitor called Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks.SynchronizedBlock . To get Coyote test control over your synchronized blocks simply replace: lock (this.syncObject) with: using (var monitor = SynchronizedBlock.Lock(this.syncObject)) and replace calls to System.Threading.Monitor.Wait and System.Threading.Monitor.Pulse with calls to the new variable monitor.Wait and monitor.Pulse instead. Then when you run your coyote test on this code you will get systematic testing of all interleavings around this lock. Note: you must also avoid using await on asynchronous tasks inside a SynchronizedBlock.Lock . If Coyote detects any task switching inside a synchronized block you will see an error message saying \u201cObject synchronization method was called from a task that did not create this SynchronizedBlock\u201d . Bugs involving System.Threading.Monitor can be extremely tricky to debug due to their heisenbug nature. Coyote testing eliminates this problem and can given you clear 100% reproducible bug schedules that you can replay as slowly as you need to see what is really going on leading up to such bugs.

In production, this type is simply a thin wrapper over the native .NET System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCompletionSource<TResult> type, providing the same operational semantics that you are familiar with. Why is a task completion source necessary? In many asynchronous scenarios, it is useful to create a Task<TResult> and pass it to one or more consumers, which can then await for this task to complete to get its result. The controlled TaskCompletionSource<TResult> type of Coyote acts as the producer for such a Task<TResult> . The owner of the TaskCompletionSource<TResult> is able to control the state of the produced Task<TResult> and complete it by setting its result. You can learn more about the semantics of a task completion source in the .NET documentation of the native TaskCompletionSource<T> type . How do you use it? First, create a new controlled TaskCompletionSource<TResult> using the static method TaskCompletionSource.Create<TResult>() . Then, you can get the controlled Task<TResult> associated with this task completion source, using the TaskCompletionSource.Task property, and share it with one or more consumers. Finally, you can use the TaskCompletionSource to complete the produced Task<TResult> . You can do this using the methods of the controlled task completion source: SetResult() SetException() SetCanceled() , or their TrySet* variants: TrySetResult() TrySetException() TrySetCanceled() Why are there two sets of methods, namely, the Set* methods that return void and their TrySet* variants that return bool ? The reason is that the controlled Task<TResult> associated with the TaskCompletionSource<TResult> may only be completed once, thus attempting to set this task into a completed state when it\u2019s already in a completed state is an error, and the Set* methods will throw. However, as we\u2019re dealing with concurrency here, and there are some situations where races may be expected between multiple threads trying to resolve the completion source, the TrySet* variants return bool indicating success rather than throwing an exception. Example code The code below demonstrates a controlled TaskCompletionSource<TResult> in action. This represents the most typical scenario in which programmers need and use a task completion source, namely to know when a long-running operation, that itself is not awaitable, has finished. using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; public void StartLongOperation(TaskCompletionSource<bool> tcs) { Console.WriteLine(\"Producer: Running a long operation...\"); // ... do something that takes a long time. // This may include calling a 3rd party library that is not awaitable. Console.WriteLine(\"Producer: Completed the long operation.\"); tcs.SetResult(true); Console.WriteLine(\"Producer: Completed the task completion source.\"); } The above StartLongOperation method is responsible for running some long operation. Although the method is not awaitable, as it returns void , it can signal its completion by setting the result of the controlled TaskCompletionSource<bool> to true . A consumer of the task produced by this task completion source can await on its completion using the following code: using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; // The input task is the task produced by the task completion source. public async Task Consumer(Task<bool> task) { Console.WriteLine(\"Consumer: Waiting the long operation to complete...\"); await task; Console.WriteLine(\"Consumer: The long operation has completed so we can proceed with other work.\"); } You can now use a TaskCompletionSource to coordinate this long running operation with another async Task that needs to wait on the completion of that operation like this: private async Task RunTest() { var completion = TaskCompletionSource.Create<bool>(); this.StartLongOperation(completion); await this.Consumer(completion.Task); Console.WriteLine(\"Main test complete!\"); } The output of this program will look something like this: Producer: Running a long operation...

Coyote additionally defines the higher-level metric Actor Activity Coverage that reports state transitions and the percentage of possible events that are actually executed during a run of coyote tester. Coyote coverage options Running coyote /? displays a summary of command-line options. Here is the section describing options to report code and activity coverage: Code and activity coverage options: ----------------------------------- -c, --coverage string : Generate code coverage statistics (via VS instrumentation) with zero or more values equal to: code: Generate code coverage statistics (via VS instrumentation) activity: Generate activity (state machine, event, etc.) coverage statistics activity-debug: Print activity coverage statistics with debug info -instr, --instrument string : Additional file spec(s) to instrument for code coverage (wildcards supported) -instr-list, --instrument-list string : File containing the paths to additional file(s) to instrument for code coverage, one per line, wildcards supported, lines starting with '//' are skipped Detailed descriptions are provided in subsequent sections. The following provides a quick overview. Note that --coverage is the equivalent of specifying --coverage code activity . If --coverage or --coverage code is specified, all DLLs in the dependency chain between the assembly being tested (specified by the path argument) and any Microsoft.Coyote.*.dll are instrumented to collect code coverage data. The --instrument options allow you specify other DLLs that don\u2019t depend on Coyote but should also be instrumented (for example, utility libraries). File names can be absolute or relative to the assembly being tested (specified by the path argument). --coverage activity and --coverage activity-debug do not instrument assemblies. In this case Coyote maintains the history of events and state transitions for reporting the coverage of the actors and state machines being tested. Output file locations By default, at the end of testing the report files are written to a directory named Output/[assemblyToTest]/CoyoteOutput in the directory specified by the path argument. If --outdir outputDirectory is specified, then the files are written to the directory [outputDirectory]/CoyoteOutput . Details of the report files that are created for the separate coverage types are provided in subsequent sections. Actor activity coverage Actor activity coverage includes event coverage, which is defined in the following section, as well as a summary of states that were entered and exited and which state transitions occurred. Definition of event coverage A tuple (M, S, E) is said to be defined if state S of machine M is prepared to receive an event of type E, i.e., it has an action defined for the event. A tuple (M, S, E) is said to be covered by a test run if state S of machine M actually dequeues an event of type E during an execution. Event coverage is the number of tuples covered divided by the number of tuples defined in the program. The higher this metric, the better testing exercised all these combinations in the program. As with other coverage metrics, obtaining 100% coverage may be unrealistic as it depends on the particular test harness being used. Activity coverage output files If the option --coverage , --coverage activity , or --coverage activity-debug is passed to coyote , the following files will be written to the output directory (for example, given path equal to PingPong.exe ): * PingPong.coverage.txt . This file contains the Event Coverage metric along with a breakdown per machine and per state. It also summarizes other useful coverage information. * PingPong.dgml . This file contains the Event Coverage visualization as described below. * PingPong.sci . This is the serialized CoverageInfo object for the test run. Such \u2018sci\u2019 files from multiple runs can be passed to CoyoteCoverageReportMerger.exe to create a merged report. * If --coverage activity-debug was specified, then there will also be a Debug directory containing the same files as above for each process, with the filename qualified by a sequential process id, e.g: PingPong.coverage_0.txt Note that while --coverage is a shortcut for specifying both --coverage code and --coverage activity , you must specify --coverage activity-debug explicitly. Activity coverage visualization example The activity coverage can additionally be displayed in DGML diagram format. Run coyote as described in the coyote examples section below. This produces a file in the DGML format as described in the activity coverage output files section. Open the file using Visual Studio. It captures machines, states and transitions witnessed during the testing of the program. The file also contains inter-machine transitions. These transitions are usually auto-hidden when opened in Visual Studio, but visible when you click on a state. Code coverage For code coverage, coyote instruments the path assembly and the binaries it depends upon via VSInstr.exe . VSPerfCmd.exe is launched while the test runs, and is terminated when the test is complete. For code coverage to work you must ensure your project is built using Full PDBs which you can do by specifying the following build properties: <PropertyGroup> <DebugType>full</DebugType> <DebugSymbols>true</DebugSymbols> </PropertyGroup> VSPerfCmd.exe collects data from all running processes, so do not run multiple coverage tests at the same time. Code coverage binary instrumentation coyote instruments the following binaries (via VSInstr.exe ): * path : this is the path to the assembly that is being tested. * Each DLL in the dependency graph of the assembly specified by the path argument - not including Microsoft.Coyote.dll , mscorlib or any System* assemblies. * Any additional assemblies specified by one of the --instrument or --instrument-list options. By default the VS 2019 tools are used. These are set in coyote.exe.config and are based on the environment variable $(DevEnvDir) which is automatically defined if you use a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt. The actual paths can be overridden by environment variables with the same names as the app settings: VSInstrToolPath VSPerfCmdToolPath Code coverage output files If the option --coverage or --coverage code is passed to coyote , the following files will be written to the output directory (for example, if path is PingPong.exe ): PingPong.coverage . This file contains the code coverage data that can be read by Visual Studio. To do so, load it as a file into VS, then select Mixed Debugging. The same Coyote output folder will contain all the instrumented binaries that were used to run the test. The original binaries are left unchanged. The instrumented binaries are retained because VS requires the matching instrumented binaries to be able to load the .coverage file. If you want keep track of code-coverage improvements over time you can use the coyote test --outdir option to collect multiple coverage files in different locations. Coyote test examples First build the coyote-samples repo by running the following command: powershell -f build.ps1 Then run coyote with one of the coverage flags, as well as the other options you want. Here are some minimal examples: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/Monitors.exe -i 10 --coverage This will create the directory ./bin/net5.0/Output/Monitors.exe/CoyoteOutput/ , then it generates coverage files for code coverage which you can load into Visual Studio to see the results. coyote test ./bin/net5.0/Monitors.exe -i 10 -coverage activity -o \"/Coyote_Coverage/Monitors\" This will create the directory /Coyote_Coverage/Monitors/CoyoteOutput , then it generates only activity coverage. coyote test ./bin/net5.0/Monitors.exe -i 10 --coverage code activity-debug This generates code and activity coverage, including debug activity output. Troubleshooting Error VSP1394: Could not start profile monitor This could happen if you are trying to run coyote test from a current directory that contains conflicting binaries from the ones you are testing.

If you find that your test must call some code that potentially violates these restrictions, then you must mock the call for the purpose of the test. Stick to your programming model The test must only have concurrency in the chosen Coyote programming model. The following code that spawns both a controlled Coyote Task as well as an native .NET Task is going to confuse the tester because it would not know how to control the scheduling of the latter. using CoyoteTasks = Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; using SystemTasks = System.Threading.Tasks; [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static async CoyoteTasks.Task MyTest() { // bad: do not do this. var t1 = CoyoteTasks.Task.Run(() => { foo(); }); var t2 = SystemTasks.Task.Run(() => { bar(); }); ... } The tester does its best to identify concurrency outside its control (e.g., the task t2 above) and complain so that you can debug your code, but it is not always able to do so. The same holds for synchronization operations, e.g., acquiring or releasing locks via the lock construct. In this case, the tester can deadlock if there is synchronization in the test that it does not know about. In most cases, Coyote code would be free of these low-level synchronization operations. If you must use a lock and you are using the Coyote Tasks programming model try the Coyote AsyncLock .

In such a case, for the purpose of the test, the branch should instead be based on a call to Microsoft.Coyote.Random.Generator , which can be recorded and replayed by the tester.

Because of the above capabilities, the coyote tester is capable of quickly discovering bugs that would be very hard to discover using traditional testing techniques. During testing, the coyote tester executes a program from start to finish for a given number of testing iterations. During each iteration, the tester is exploring a potentially different serialized execution path. If a bug is discovered, the tester will terminate and dump a reproducible trace (including a human readable version of it). If you get unexpected errors, please check that your test code is adhering to the Tester requirements . See below to learn how to reproduce traces and debug them using a supported version of Visual Studio. Test entry point A Coyote test method can be declared as follows: [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { runtime.RegisterMonitor(typeof(SomeMonitor)); runtime.CreateActor(typeof(SomeMachine)); } This method acts as the entry point to each testing iteration. Note that the coyote test tool will internally create a TestingEngine , which invokes the test method and executes it. This allows it to capture and report any errors that occur outside the scope of an actor (e.g. before the very first actor is created). The coyote test tool supports calling the following test method signatures: [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void Execute(); [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime); [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static async Task Execute(); [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static async Task Execute(IActorRuntime runtime); Note that similar to unit-testing, static state should be appropriately reset before each test iteration because the iterations run in shared memory. However, parallel instances of the tester run in separate processes, which provides isolation. Testing options To see the list of available command line options use the flag -? . You can optionally give the number of testing iterations to perform using --iterations N (where N is an integer > 1). If this option is not provided, the tester will perform 1 iteration by default. You can also provide a timeout, by providing the flag --timeout N (where N > 0), specifying how many seconds before the timeout. If no iterations are specified (thus the default number of iterations is used), then the tester will perform testing iterations until the timeout is reached. Another important flag is --max-steps N . This limits each test iteration to be N steps, after which the iteration is killed and a new one is started. Here, steps are counted as the number of times a synchronization point is reached in the program. The tester provides output at the end of a test run on the iteration lengths that it saw. Use this output for calibrating the best value of N for your case. This flag is usually only needed when your test has the potential of generating non-terminating executions (like an infinite series of ping pong events, for example). In such cases, if you do not provide max-steps then the tester can appear to can get stuck running one iteration forever. This is related to liveness checking . Parallel and portfolio testing The Coyote tester supports parallel testing, often used with a portfolio of different schedulers. To enable parallel testing, you must run coyote , and provide the flag --parallel N (where N > 0), with N specifying the number of parallel testing processes to be spawned. By default, the tester spawns the same testing process multiple times (using different random seeds). When doing parallel testing it is often useful to provide the --sch-portfolio flag. This option allocates different exploration strategies to each spawned test process which increases the chance that one of the test processes will find a particularly difficult bug. Reproducing and debugging traces The coyote replayer can be used to deterministically reproduce and debug buggy executions (found by coyote test ). To run the replayer use the following command: coyote replay ${YOUR_PROGRAM} ${SCHEDULE_TRACE}.schedule Where ${SCHEDULE_TRACE}}.schedule is the trace file dumped by coyote test . You can attach the Visual Studio debugger on this trace by using --break . When using this flag, Coyote will automatically instrument a breakpoint when the bug is found. You can also insert your own breakpoints in the source code as usual. --break uses System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch which does not seem to work on MacOS or Linux, see troubleshooting below for an alternate way of debugging replay schedules. See the replay options section of the help output from invoking coyote -? . Graphing the results The --graph command line option produces a DGML diagram containing a graphical trace of all the state transitions that happened in all test iterations. The --graph-bug command line option is similar but produces a graph only of the last test iteration leading up to a bug. These graphs are different from the graph generated by --coverage activity because the coverage graph collapses all machine instances into one group, so you can more easily see the whole coverage of that machine type. The --graph options are handy when you need to see the difference in state that happened in different machine instances. See animating state machine demo for a visual explanation of what coyote test does when it is looking for bugs. In the animation you will see why the test failed, two of the server nodes have taken on the Leader role, which is not allowed. See also the DGML diagram which you can open in Visual Studio. Here the Server state machines are colored in green, and the Leader states in red to highlight the bug found. Unit Testing To use Coyote tester in a unit test environment see Unit Testing . Troubleshooting \u2013break does not seem to work on MacOS or Linux --break depends on System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch and it seems that this is not supported on MacOS or Linux.

Systems designers usually provide failover capability in servers, systems or networks requiring near-continuous availability and a high degree of reliability.\u201d This sample applies the failover concept to the firmware of an automated espresso machine using the Coyote asynchronous actors programming model. Imagine what would happen if the tiny CPU running the machine rebooted in the middle of making a coffee. What bad things might happen? Can we design a state machine that can handle this scenario and provide a more fault tolerant coffee machine? An identical version of this tutorial is available that uses the coyote asynchronous tasks programming model. The following diagram shows how Coyote can be used to test this scenario and help you design more reliable software. The CoffeeMachine is modeled as an asynchronous state machine . This example is not providing real firmware, instead it mocks the hardware sensor platform built into the machine. This is done in MockSensors.cs where you will find three actors that model various hardware components: MockDoorSensor , MockWaterTank and MockCoffeeGrinder . This actor provides async ways of reading sensor values like Water temperature and water levels, or turning on and off the coffee grinder and so on. The CoffeeMachine does not know the sensors are mocks, all it knows is the public interface defined in SensorEvents.cs . In this way the CoffeeMachine is production code, while the mocks are only for testing. The reason we are using an asynchronous model is that even in the smallest of devices, often times there is a message passing architecture where different hardware components are connected via some sort of bus, whether it is a simple serial port, or something more sophisticated like a CAN bus . We will test that we can kill the CoffeeMachine and restart it without anything bad happening. This test is setup by the FailoverDriver . The FailoverDriver lets the first CoffeeMachine instance run for a bit then it randomly kills it by using the HaltEvent , then it starts a new CoffeeMachine . The new CoffeeMachine instance needs to figure out the state of the sensors such that when a MakeCoffeeEvent arrives, it doesn\u2019t do something silly that breaks the machine. The mock sensors are not killed so that it acts as a persistent store for sensor state across all instances of the CoffeeMachine . Some safety Asserts are placed in the code that verify certain important things, including: - do not turn on heater if there is no water - do not turn on grinder if there are no beans in the hopper - do not turn on shot maker if there is no water - do not do anything if the door is open There is also a correctness assert in the CoffeeMachine to make sure the correct number of espresso shots are made and there is a LivenessMonitor that monitors the CoffeeMachine to make sure it never gets stuck, i.e., it always finishes the job it was given or it goes to an error state if the machine needs to be fixed. See Liveness Checking . A number of excellent bugs were found by coyote test during the development of this sample, and this illustrates the fact that Coyote can be applied to any type of asynchronous software, not just cloud services. There is still one bug remaining in the code which you can find using coyote test , and it happens after failover just to prove the usefulness of this testing methodology. What you will need To run the CoffeeMachine example, you will need to: Install Visual Studio 2019 . Install the .NET Core 3.1 version of the coyote tool . Clone the Coyote Samples git repo . Be familiar with the coyote test tool. See Testing . Build the samples Build the coyote-samples repo by running the following command: powershell -f build.ps1 Run the failover coffee machine application Now you can run the CoffeeMachine application: \"./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineActors.exe\" The coffee machine There are many different types of coffee machines. This example is based on the following machine which can automatically heat water, grind beans, and make an espresso shot all with the press of a button: The following diagram shows the states and actions in our example implementation in the CoffeeMachine class: When you run the executable without using coyote test (this is called running in production mode ), you will see the following console output. Notice in the output below that the FailoverDriver forces the termination of the CoffeeMachine right in the middle of making a coffee. Then when the CoffeeMachine is restarted, the FailoverDriver requests another coffee and the CoffeeMachine is able to continue on, the water is already warm, and it dumps the old grinds so you have the freshest possible coffee each time. <FailoverDriver> starting new CoffeeMachine. <CoffeeMachine> initializing... <CoffeeMachine> checking initial state of sensors... <CoffeeMachine> Water level is 60 % <CoffeeMachine> Hopper level is 93 % <CoffeeMachine> Warming the water to 100 degrees <CoffeeMachine> Turning on the water heater <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is warming up (64 degrees)... <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is warming up (74 degrees)... <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is warming up (84 degrees)... <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is warming up (94 degrees)... <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine water temperature is now 100 <CoffeeMachine> Turning off the water heater <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is ready to make coffee (green light is on) <CoffeeMachine> Coffee requested, shots=1 <CoffeeMachine> Grinding beans... <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 10 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 20 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 30 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 40 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 50 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 60 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 70 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 80 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 90 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is full <CoffeeMachine> Making shots... <FailoverDriver> forcing termination of CoffeeMachine. <CoffeeMachine> Coffee Machine Terminating... <CoffeeMachine> ################################################################# <CoffeeMachine> # Coffee Machine Halted # <CoffeeMachine> ################################################################# <FailoverDriver> starting new CoffeeMachine. <CoffeeMachine> initializing... <CoffeeMachine> checking initial state of sensors... <CoffeeMachine> Water level is 60 % <CoffeeMachine> Hopper level is 83 % <CoffeeMachine> Dumping old smelly grinds! <CoffeeMachine> Warming the water to 100 degrees <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine water temperature is now 100 <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is ready to make coffee (green light is on) <CoffeeMachine> Coffee requested, shots=2 <CoffeeMachine> Grinding beans... <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 10 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 20 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 30 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 40 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 50 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 60 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 70 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 80 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 90 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is full <CoffeeMachine> Making shots... <CoffeeMachine> Shot count is 1 <CoffeeMachine> 2 shots completed and 2 shots requested! <CoffeeMachine> Dumping the grinds! <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is ready to make coffee (green light is on) <FailoverDriver> CoffeeMachine completed the job. ... The test will continue on making coffee until it runs out of either water or coffee beans and the FailoverDriver halts each CoffeeMachine instance at random times until the machine is out of resources, at which point the test is complete. The mock sensors also randomly choose some error conditions, so instead of the above you may see some errors like: <CoffeeMachine> Cannot safely operate coffee machine with the door open! <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine needs manual refilling of water and/or coffee beans! If you see these errors, press ENTER to terminate the program and run it again. These random start conditions help the test cover more cases. Each halted machine is terminated and discarded, then a new CoffeeMachine instance is started that must figure out what is happening with the sensors and make the next coffee without incident. Eventually a CoffeeMachine will report there is no more water or coffee beans and then it will stop with an error message saying the machine needs to be manually refilled. Coyote testing You can now use coyote test to exercise the code and see if any bugs can be found. From the coyote-samples folder: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineActors.dll -i 100 -ms 2000 --sch-pct 10 --graph-bug Chances are this will find a bug quickly, one of the safety assertions will fire and you will see that a test output log and DGML diagram are produced, like this: .\\bin\\net5.0\\Output\\CoffeeMachineActors.exe\\CoyoteOutput\\CoffeeMachine_0_0.txt .\\bin\\net5.0\\Output\\CoffeeMachineActors.exe\\CoyoteOutput\\CoffeeMachine_0_0.dgml This log can be pretty big, a couple thousand lines where each line represents one async operation. This log contains only the one iteration that failed, and towards the end you will see something like this: <ActionLog> Microsoft.Coyote.Samples.CoffeeMachineActors.MockCoffeeGrinder(3) invoked action 'OnGrinderButton'. <ErrorLog> Please do not turn on grinder if there are no beans in the hopper So the CoffeeMachine accidentally tried to grind beans when the hopper was empty. If you look at the resulting DGML diagram you will see exactly what happened: The Timer machines were removed from this diagram just for simplicity. The FailoverDriver started the first CoffeeMachine on the left which ran to completion but it ran low on coffee beans. Then this first machine was halted. The FailoverDriver then started a new CoffeeMachine , which made it all the way to GrindingBeans where it tripped the safety assertion in MockCoffeeGrinder . So the bug here is that somehow, the second CoffeeMachine instance missed the fact that it was low on coffee beans. A bug exists in the code somewhere. Can you find it? It is not a trivial bug because the CheckSensors state is clearly checking the coffee level by sending the ReadHopperLevelEvent to the MockCoffeeGrinder actor and CheckInitialState does not advance to the HeatingWater state until this reading is returned. So what happened? Hint: if you search backwards in the output log you will find the following situation reported in CheckState : <CoffeeMachine> Hopper level is -5 % The first CoffeeMachine instance left the grinder running a bit too long, and the sensor got confused thinking the coffee level is negative. The new CoffeeMachine instance never thought about this situation and checked only: if ((int)this.HopperLevel.Value == 0) ... And so it missed the fact it might be negative. The fix is easy, just change this condition to <= and the bug goes away. The fact that such a tricky bug was found so quickly shows the power of using the Coyote state machine programming model together with the coyote test tool. Testing the scheduling of highly asynchronous operations This raises a bigger design question, how did the coffee level become negative? In firmware it is common to poll sensor readings and do something based on that. In this case we are polling a PortaFilterCoffeeLevelEvent in a tight loop while in the GrindingBeans state. Meanwhile the MockCoffeeGrinder class has a timer running and when HandleTimer calls MonitorGrinder it decreases the coffee level by 10 percent during every time interval. So we have an asynchronous operation going on here. Coffee level is decreasing based on a timer, and the CoffeeMachine is monitoring that coffee level using async events. This all seems to work perfectly in the production code where we see this output: <CoffeeMachine> Grinding beans... <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 10 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 20 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 30 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 40 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 50 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 60 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 70 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 80 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 90 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is full And the reason it works is because your Operating System is scheduling both of these async threads in a way that is relatively fair meaning one does not run for a long time without the other being scheduled also. But what if these two systems were running in a distributed world and one of them hangs for a long time? This is the kind of thread scheduling that coyote test is testing where one machine can run way ahead of another. You need to take this into account when using this kind of timer based async events . One way to improve the design in a firmware based system like a coffee machine is to switch from a polling based system to an interrupt based system where the MockCoffeeGrinder can send important events to the CoffeeMachine . This style of interrupt based eventing is used to model the ShotCompleteEvent , WaterHotEvent , WaterEmptyEvent and HopperEmptyEvent . This shows how Coyote can help find actual design flaws in your code so you can design a system that is more robust in the face of unexpected faults. The coyote test engine provides several different scheduling strategies that test different kinds of fairness algorithms. These are designed to find different kinds of bugs. The following command line shows how to use --sch-portfolio and the --parallel options to test a bunch of different strategies in parallel, each in different test processes: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineActors.dll -i 100 -ms 2000 --sch-pct 10 --graph-bug --sch-portfolio --parallel 8 which outputs the following: . Testing .\\bin\\net5.0\\CoffeeMachineActors.dll Starting TestingProcessScheduler in process 42036 ... Created '8' testing tasks. ... Task 3 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:2143). ... Task 5 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:3489). ... Task 2 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:1470). ... Task 7 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:4835). ... Task 0 is using 'Random' strategy (seed:124). ... Task 6 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:4162). ... Task 4 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:2816). ... Task 1 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:797). ... The --parallel 8 option means use 8 test processes in parallel with each one being assigned a random scheduling strategy. Each process runs until the first bug is found by some process, then they are all terminated and the bug is reported. This can be useful when you want to leverage the full power of your computer to find those bugs that are particularly hard to find more quickly. You can find out how much testing was actually done during this parallel test operation by adding --coverage activity . The coverage report summarizes how many of the possible events were covered. Liveness monitor As described in the documentation on Liveness Checking the CoffeeMachine must also eventually finish what it is doing. It must either make a coffee when requested and return to the Ready state, or it must find a problem and go to the Error state or the RefillRequired state. This \u201cliveness\u201d property can be enforced using a very simple LivenessMonitor as shown below: internal class LivenessMonitor : Monitor { public class BusyEvent : Event { } public class IdleEvent : Event { } [Start] [Cold] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(BusyEvent), typeof(Busy))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(IdleEvent))] private class Idle : State { } [Hot] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(IdleEvent), typeof(Idle))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(BusyEvent))] private class Busy : State { } } This type of Monitor is also a kind of state machine. The CoffeeMachine can send events to this monitor to tell it when it has switched into Busy state or Idle state. When the CoffeeMachine starts heating water, or making coffee it sends this event: this.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.BusyEvent()); and when the CoffeeMachine is done making coffee or it has moved to an error state it sends this event: this.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.IdleEvent()); The Busy state is marked as a [Hot] state and the Idle state is marked as a [Cold] state. During testing if coyote test finds the LivenessMonitor to be stuck in the [Hot] state too long it raises an exception and the test fails. Reliable termination handshake You may notice in the code that when the FailoverDriver wants to stop the first CoffeeMachine it sends a CoffeeMachine.TerminateEvent and waits for a CoffeeMachine.HaltedEvent before it starts a new CoffeeMachine by running this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Test>() . This may seem a bit convoluted compared to just this.SendEvent(this.CoffeeMachineId, HaltEvent.Instance) followed by this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Test>() . The reason a direct halt event was not used in this case is because a HaltEvent is processed asynchronously, which means the RaiseGotoStateEvent would end up creating the new CoffeeMachine instance before the old one was fully halted. This can lead to confusion in the mock sensors which are written to expect one and only one client CoffeeMachine at a time. The TerminateEvent handshake solves that problem. Since the TerminateEvent could be sent to the CoffeeMachine at any time we need an easy way to handle this event at any time in CoffeeMachine , hopefully without having to decorate every single state in the machine with the custom attribute: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(TerminateEvent), nameof(OnTerminate))] The solution is to promote this OnEventDoAction to the class level. Class level handlers are handled like a fall back mechanism so that no matter what state the CoffeeMachine is in the class level handler can be invoked, unless the current state overrides that handler. Summary Failover testing is simple to achieve using Coyote and yields many interesting bugs in your code, including some thought-provoking design bugs. The technique of halting your \u201cproduction\u201d actors/state-machines, and recreating them by reading from a \u201cpersistent\u201d mock (which is not halted during testing) can be generalized to many other scenarios (e.g. cloud services) where someone needs to test failover logic of production actors using Coyote.

Systems designers usually provide failover capability in servers, systems or networks requiring near-continuous availability and a high degree of reliability.\u201d This sample applies the failover concept to the firmware of an automated espresso machine using the Coyote asynchronous actors programming model. Imagine what would happen if the tiny CPU running the machine rebooted in the middle of making a coffee. What bad things might happen? Can we design a state machine that can handle this scenario and provide a more fault tolerant coffee machine? An identical version of this tutorial is available that uses the coyote asynchronous tasks programming model. The following diagram shows how Coyote can be used to test this scenario and help you design more reliable software. The CoffeeMachine is modeled as an asynchronous state machine . This example is not providing real firmware, instead it mocks the hardware sensor platform built into the machine. This is done in MockSensors.cs where you will find three actors that model various hardware components: MockDoorSensor , MockWaterTank and MockCoffeeGrinder . This actor provides async ways of reading sensor values like Water temperature and water levels, or turning on and off the coffee grinder and so on. The CoffeeMachine does not know the sensors are mocks, all it knows is the public interface defined in SensorEvents.cs . In this way the CoffeeMachine is production code, while the mocks are only for testing. The reason we are using an asynchronous model is that even in the smallest of devices, often times there is a message passing architecture where different hardware components are connected via some sort of bus, whether it is a simple serial port, or something more sophisticated like a CAN bus . We will test that we can kill the CoffeeMachine and restart it without anything bad happening. This test is setup by the FailoverDriver . The FailoverDriver lets the first CoffeeMachine instance run for a bit then it randomly kills it by using the HaltEvent , then it starts a new CoffeeMachine . The new CoffeeMachine instance needs to figure out the state of the sensors such that when a MakeCoffeeEvent arrives, it doesn\u2019t do something silly that breaks the machine. The mock sensors are not killed so that it acts as a persistent store for sensor state across all instances of the CoffeeMachine . Some safety Asserts are placed in the code that verify certain important things, including: - do not turn on heater if there is no water - do not turn on grinder if there are no beans in the hopper - do not turn on shot maker if there is no water - do not do anything if the door is open There is also a correctness assert in the CoffeeMachine to make sure the correct number of espresso shots are made and there is a LivenessMonitor that monitors the CoffeeMachine to make sure it never gets stuck, i.e., it always finishes the job it was given or it goes to an error state if the machine needs to be fixed. See Liveness Checking . A number of excellent bugs were found by coyote test during the development of this sample, and this illustrates the fact that Coyote can be applied to any type of asynchronous software, not just cloud services. There is still one bug remaining in the code which you can find using coyote test , and it happens after failover just to prove the usefulness of this testing methodology.","title":"Failover coffee machine using actors"},{"location":"tutorials/failover-coffee-machine-actors/#what-you-will-need","text":"To run the CoffeeMachine example, you will need to: Install Visual Studio 2019 .

Imagine what would happen if the tiny CPU running the machine rebooted in the middle of making a coffee. What bad things might happen? Can we design a code that can handle this scenario and provide a more fault tolerant coffee machine? An identical version of this tutorial is also available that uses the coyote asynchronous actors programming model. The following diagram shows how Coyote can be used to test this scenario and help you design more reliable software. The CoffeeMachine is modeled as an asynchronous interface using controlled Tasks . This example it not providing real firmware, instead it mocks the hardware sensor platform built into the machine. This is done in the asynchronous MockSensors class. This class provides async ways of reading sensor values like the water temperature and setting things like the power button, or turning on and off the coffee grinder and so on. The reason we are using an asynchronous design is that even in the smallest of devices, often times there is a message passing architecture where different hardware components are connected via some sort of bus, whether it is a simple serial port, or something more sophisticated like a CAN bus . We will test that we can kill the CoffeeMachine and restart it without anything bad happening. This test is setup by the FailoverDriver . The FailoverDriver lets the first CoffeeMachine instance run for a bit then it randomly kills it by using the TerminateAsync method, then it starts a new CoffeeMachine . The new CoffeeMachine instance needs to figure out the state of the sensors such that when a MakeCoffeeEvent arrives, it doesn\u2019t do something silly that breaks the machine. The MockSensors class is not killed so that it acts as a persistent store for sensor state across all instances of the CoffeeMachine . Some safety Asserts are placed in the code that verify certain important things, including: - do not turn on heater if there is no water - do not turn on grinder if there are no beans in the hopper - do not turn on shot maker if there is no water There is also a correctness assert in the CoffeeMachine to make sure the correct number of espresso shots are made and there is a LivenessMonitor that monitors the CoffeeMachine to make sure it never gets stuck, i.e., it always finishes the job it was given or it goes to an error state if the machine needs to be fixed. See Liveness Checking . A number of excellent bugs were found by coyote test during the development of this sample, and this illustrates the fact that Coyote can be applied to any type of asynchronous software, not just cloud services. There is still one bug remaining in the code which you can find using coyote test , and it happens after failover just to prove the usefulness of this testing methodology. What you will need To run the CoffeeMachine example, you will need to: Install Visual Studio 2019 . Install the .NET Core 3.1 version of the coyote tool . Clone the Coyote Samples git repo . Be familiar with the coyote test tool. See Testing . Build the samples Build the coyote-samples repo by running the following command: powershell -f build.ps1 Run the failover coffee machine application Now you can run the CoffeeMachine application: \"./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineTasks.exe\" The Coffee Machine There are many different types of coffee machines. This example is based on the following machine which can automatically heat water, grind beans, and make an espresso shot all with the press of a button: The following diagram shows the abstract state machine that is implemented in C# code: Run the executable without using coyote test (this is called running in production mode ), you will see the following console output. Notice in the output below that the FailoverDriver forces the termination of the CoffeeMachine right in the middle of making a coffee. Then when the CoffeeMachine is restarted, the FailoverDriver requests another coffee and the CoffeeMachine is able to continue on, the water is already warm, and it dumps the old grinds so you have the freshest possible coffee each time. <FailoverDriver> ################################################################# <FailoverDriver> starting new CoffeeMachine iteration 0. <CoffeeMachine> initializing... <CoffeeMachine> checking initial state of sensors... <CoffeeMachine> Water level is 23 % <CoffeeMachine> Hopper level is 85 % <CoffeeMachine> Warming the water to 100 degrees <CoffeeMachine> Turning on the water heater <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is warming up (71 degrees)... <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is warming up (81 degrees)... <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is warming up (91 degrees)... <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine water temperature is now 100 <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine water temperature is now 100 <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is ready to make coffee (green light is on) <CoffeeMachine> Turning off the water heater <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is ready to make coffee (green light is on) <CoffeeMachine> Coffee requested, shots=2 <CoffeeMachine> Grinding beans... <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 10 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 20 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 30 % full <FailoverDriver> forcing termination of CoffeeMachine. <CoffeeMachine> Coffee Machine Terminating... <CoffeeMachine> Dumping the grinds! <CoffeeMachine> ################################################################# <CoffeeMachine> # Coffee Machine Halted # <CoffeeMachine> ################################################################# <CoffeeMachine> <FailoverDriver> ################################################################# <FailoverDriver> starting new CoffeeMachine iteration 1. <CoffeeMachine> initializing... <CoffeeMachine> checking initial state of sensors... <CoffeeMachine> Water level is 22 % <CoffeeMachine> Hopper level is 38 % <CoffeeMachine> Warming the water to 100 degrees <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine water temperature is now 100 <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine is ready to make coffee (green light is on) <CoffeeMachine> Coffee requested, shots=3 <CoffeeMachine> Grinding beans... <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 10 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 20 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 30 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 40 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 50 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 60 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 70 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 80 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 90 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is full <CoffeeMachine> Making shots... <CoffeeMachine> Shot count is 0 <CoffeeMachine> Shot count is 1 <CoffeeMachine> 2 shots completed and 2 shots requested! <CoffeeMachine> Dumping the grinds! <FailoverDriver> CoffeeMachine completed the job. ... You will not see this exact output because the test injects some randomness. The test will continue on making coffee until it runs out of either water or coffee beans and the FailoverDriver halts each CoffeeMachine instance at random times until the machine is out of resources, at which point the test is complete. The MockSensors also randomly choose some error conditions, so instead of the above you may see some errors like: <CoffeeMachine> Cannot safely operate coffee machine with the door open! <CoffeeMachine> Coffee machine needs manual refilling of water and/or coffee beans! If you see these errors, just press ENTER to terminate the program and run it again. These random start conditions just help the test cover more cases. Each halted machine is terminated and discarded, then a new CoffeeMachine instance is started. Each new CoffeeMachine instance must figure out what is happening with the sensors and make the next coffee without incident. Eventually a CoffeeMachine will report there is no more water or coffee beans and then it will stop with an error message saying the machine needs to be manually refilled. Coyote testing You can now use coyote test to exercise the code and see if any bugs can be found. From the coyote-samples folder: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineTasks.dll -i 1000 -ms 500 --sch-pct 10 Chances are this will find a bug quickly, one of the safety assertions will fire and you will see that a test output log is produced, like this: .\\bin\\net5.0\\Output\\CoffeeMachineTasks.exe\\CoyoteOutput\\CoffeeMachine_0_0.txt This log contains only the one test iteration that failed, and towards the end you will see something like this: <ErrorLog> Please do not turn on grinder if there are no beans in the hopper So the CoffeeMachine accidentally tried to grind beans when the hopper was empty. In the log you will see that the FailoverDriver has halted CoffeeMachine once or twice then the new CoffeeMachine instance which made it all the way to Grinding beans where it tripped the safety assert in MockSensors . So the bug here is that somehow, the second CoffeeMachine instance missed the fact that it was low on coffee beans. A bug exists in the code somewhere. Can you find it? It is not a trivial bug because the CheckSensors state is clearly checking the coffee level by sending the ReadHopperLevelEvent to the MockSensors actor and CheckInitialState does not advance to the HeatingWater state until this reading is returned. So what happened? Hint: if you search backwards in the output log you will find the following situation reported: <CoffeeMachine> Hopper level is -54 % The first CoffeeMachine instance left the grinder running a bit too long, and the sensor got confused thinking the coffee level is negative. The new CoffeeMachine instance never thought about this situation and checked only: if ((int)this.HopperLevel.Value == 0) ... And so it missed the fact it might be negative. The fix is easy, just change this condition to <= and the bug goes away. The fact that such a tricky bug was found so quickly shows the power of using the Coyote state machine programming model together with the coyote test tool. Testing the scheduling of highly asynchronous operations This raises a bigger design question, how did the coffee level become negative? In firmware it is common to poll sensor readings and do something based on that. In this case we are polling a PortaFilterCoffeeLevelEvent in a tight loop while in the GrindingBeans state. Meanwhile the MockSensors class has a ControlledTimer running and when MonitorGrinder is called it decreases the coffee level by 10 percent during every time interval. So we have a very asynchronous operation going on here. Coffee level is decreasing based on a timer, and the CoffeeMachine is monitoring that coffee level using async events. This all seems to work perfectly in the production code where we see this output: <CoffeeMachine> Grinding beans... <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 10 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 20 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 30 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 40 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 50 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 60 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 70 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 80 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is 90 % full <CoffeeMachine> PortaFilter is full And the reason it works is because your Operating System is scheduling both of these async threads in a way that is relatively fair meaning one does not run for a long time without the other being scheduled also. But what if these two systems were running in a distributed world and one of them hangs for a long time? This is the kind of thread scheduling that coyote test is testing where one set of async tasks can run way ahead of the others. You need to take this into account when using timer based async events. One way to improve the design in a firmware based system like a coffee machine is to switch from a polling based system to an interrupt based system where the MockSensors can send important events to the CoffeeMachine . This style of interrupt based eventing is used to model the ShotCompleteEvent , WaterHotEvent , WaterEmptyEvent and HopperEmptyEvent . This shows how Coyote can help find actual design flaws in your code so you can design a system that is more robust in the face of unexpected faults. The coyote test engine provides several different scheduling strategies that test different kinds of fairness algorithms. These are designed to find different kinds of bugs. The following command line shows how to use --sch-portfolio and the --parallel options to test a bunch of different strategies in parallel, each in different test processes: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/CoffeeMachineTasks.dll -i 1000 -ms 500 --sch-portfolio --parallel 8 which outputs the following: . Testing .\\bin\\net5.0\\CoffeeMachineTasks.dll Starting TestingProcessScheduler in process 42036 ... Created '8' testing tasks. ... Task 3 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:2143). ... Task 5 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:3489). ... Task 2 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:1470). ... Task 7 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:4835). ... Task 0 is using 'Random' strategy (seed:124). ... Task 6 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:4162). ... Task 4 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:2816). ... Task 1 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:797). ... The --parallel 8 option means use 8 test processes in parallel, each one is assigned a random scheduling strategy. Each process runs until the first one finds a bug, then they are all terminated and the bug is reported. This can be useful when you want to leverage the full power of your computer to find those bugs that are particularly hard to find more quickly. Liveness monitor As described in the documentation on Liveness Checking the CoffeeMachine must also eventually finish what it is doing. It must either make a coffee when requested and return to the Ready state, or it must find a problem and go to the Error state or the RefillRequired state. This \u201cliveness\u201d property can be enforced using a very simple LivenessMonitor as shown below: internal class LivenessMonitor : Monitor { public class BusyEvent : Event { } public class IdleEvent : Event { } [Start] [Cold] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(BusyEvent), typeof(Busy))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(IdleEvent))] private class Idle : State { } [Hot] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(IdleEvent), typeof(Idle))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(BusyEvent))] private class Busy : State { } } This type of Monitor is also a special kind of limited state machine . The CoffeeMachine can send events to this monitor to tell it when it has switched into Busy state or Idle state. When the CoffeeMachine starts heating water, or making coffee it sends this event: Specification.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.BusyEvent()); and when the CoffeeMachine is done making coffee or it has moved to an error state it sends this event: Specification.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.IdleEvent()); The Busy state is marked as a [Hot] state and the Idle state is marked as a [Cold] state. During testing if coyote test finds the LivenessMonitor to be stuck in the [Hot] state too long it raises an exception and the test fails. Reliable termination handshake You may notice in the code that when the FailoverDriver wants to stop the first CoffeeMachine it calls TerminateAsync and waits for this async task to complete before it starts a new CoffeeMachine . This may seem a bit convoluted but you can\u2019t just create a new CoffeeMachine hoping the old one would be garbage collected because this would lead to confusion in the MockSensors class which was written to expect one and only one client CoffeeMachine at a time. The TerminateAsync handshake solves that problem. Summary Failover testing is simple to achieve using Coyote and yields many interesting bugs in your code, including some thought provoking design bugs. The technique of halting your \u201cproduction\u201d objects, and recreating them by reading from a \u201cpersistent\u201d mock (which is not halted during testing) can be generalized to many other scenarios (e.g. cloud services) where someone needs to test failover logic of production code using Coyote.

It is not always possible to follow the straight line connecting the Robot \u2018s location with that of the selected client as there are obstacles, like furniture, in the room. Thus, the Robot asks the Navigator to produce a collision-free route from the Robot \u2018s location to the person who will be served. The Navigator provides the requested route that must be reached, with the last being that of the client. A route is simply a list of consecutive straight line segments. The Robot traverses the route and reaches the client. Then the Robot selects randomly an appropriate drink for the client: alcoholic for an adult and non-alcoholic for a minor client. The Robot pours a glass of the selected drink for the client and retreats to its InitialLocation . The steps 1 to 5 above are repeated continuously. To make this a failover test, at random times the Navigator is killed and a new Navigator is created to replace the old one. When this happens it is required that the system will continue to operate flawlessly: no data (request or response) between the Robot and a Navigator will be lost, and the Robot will not stop doing its job. The following diagram depicts the Failover workflow in this sample: Do note: 1. This is a general diagram that can be used not only in this scenario, but for any other scenarios involving a robot that operates with the help of object recognition and route planning. 2. The green nodes represent the product code we are testing here, and everything else is mock test infrastructure. The main goal is to show the use of coyote test in finding concurrency issues even at the design stage when the actual implementation hasn\u2019t started. For this reason we\u2019ve only provided mock implementations of the cognitive service, the route planner, and the storage service. The Navigator doesn\u2019t know these are mock implementations. 3. The sample uses the FailoverDriver component to perform the termination of the Navigator and the creation of a new Navigator . Also a MockStorage component is used to store the state needed to restart the newly-created instance without loss of state. The Robot and the Navigator are modeled as state machines and they are started by another state machine called FailoverDriver . The FailoverDriver lets the first Navigator instance run for a bit then it randomly kills it by sending it the TerminateEvent , then it starts a new Navigator . The new Navigator instance needs to figure out the state of any previous request: was the prior Navigator killed while having an incompletely processed request from the Robot or not? To be able to do so the Navigator stores any newly received request from the Robot in the MockStorage where it remains until the request is completely processed and the response is sent to the Robot and at that moment the Navigator deletes the pending request record from the MockStorage . Note that this is going one step further than the Coffee Machine example. In this example, not only are we testing that the Navigator can restart successfully, but we are also testing that the Robot is also able to handle that failover condition. The following diagram shows the overall plan where Navigator2 is able to complete the request started by Navigator1: The MockStorage is an Actor that provides simple key-value storage for persisting data and its instance lives across all instances of the Navigator . MockStorage makes Navigator failover possible. The MockStorage component, as its name implies, is a mock of a real-world service that provides similar storage capabilities. Likewise, the MockCognitiveService and MockRoutePlanner are mocks of real-world services providing cognitive services (such as object identification) and motion-path planning. Some safety Asserts are placed in the code that verify certain important things, including: - on reaching the client the Robot \u2018s coordinates must be the same as the client\u2019s. - the key retrieved from the MockStorage when requesting a read for a saved Robot \u2018s request is an expected non-null string. - the Navigator checks that after MockStorage performs a write operation to save a Robot \u2018s request this has not overwritten another existing value for the same storage key. This ensures a request from the Robot is not lost. - all required non-null parameters for MockStorage operations (such as key or requestorId ) are indeed non-null. There is a LivenessMonitor that monitors the execution of the system to make sure it never gets stuck, i.e., the Robot always gets a valid response to any of its requests from the Navigator and serves the selected client. See Liveness Checking . A number of excellent bugs were found by coyote test during the development of this sample, and this illustrates the fact that Coyote can be applied to find bugs quickly, even in the design stage, before coding and pushing to production. What you will need To run the DrinksServingRobotActors example, you will need to: Install Visual Studio 2019 . Install the .NET Core 3.1 version of the coyote tool . Clone the Coyote Samples git repo . Be familiar with the coyote test tool. See Testing .

Each halted machine is terminated and discarded, then a new Navigator instance is started. Each new Navigator instance figures out the exact state it should continue from, and you see that the Robot continues without incident. You can now use coyote test to test the code and see if any bugs can be found. From the CoyoteSamples folder enter this command: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/DrinksServingRobotActors.dll -i 1000 -ms 2000 --sch-pct 10 Chances are this will find a bug quickly, and you will see output from the test like this: .

So the DrinksServingRobot has a liveness bug. Just 0.6 seconds were enough for coyote test to find this liveness bug, with 30 test iterations each doing up to 2000 async operations. This bug is hard to reproduce in a production run of the DrinksServingRobot. A bug exists in the code somewhere. Can you find it? You can find an explanation and fix at the end of this tutorial. How the sample works You already know the main components of the Drinks Serving Robot sample. Now is the time to understand the details. As with other tutorials the code that starts the program consists of a [Test] method that takes an IActorRuntime : public static class Program { private static bool RunForever = false; public static void Main() { ... RunForever = true; IActorRuntime runtime = RuntimeFactory.Create(conf); Execute(runtime); Console.ReadLine(); } [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { runtime.RegisterMonitor<LivenessMonitor>(); ActorId driver = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(FailoverDriver), new FailoverDriver.ConfigEvent(RunForever)); } } You already know from the Hello World tutorials how the two main entry points are used in a Coyote program. What is new here is that the Execute() method registers a LivenessMonitor used by Coyote to find liveness bugs. The rest of the execution is controlled by the FailoverDriver . The FailoverDriver The FailoverDriver state machine has two states: Init : This is the initial state of the machine where it creates everything, including the MockStorage , Navigator and Robot machines. Active : When the robot is ready, a timer is started to begin the failover process by going to the next state. TerminatingNavigator : This state performs the failover of the Navigator . It does this by sending a special termination event to the Navigator , and once that is confirmed, it goes back to the Active state where a new Navigator will be created. This happens once during a coyote test run, and it happens forever when running in production mode. The Robot The Robot has the most states compared to all state machines in this sample as it does all the visible work: the Start state Init , Active , ExecutingOrder , ReachingClient , MovingOnRoute , ServingClient , and FinishState . The Init and Active states perform processing that is relevant from the perspective of failover, while the remaining states do simple serving-related processing and aren\u2019t described in detail here. You can review the code of the sample to see exactly what the Robot does to serve the client. Init : This is the initial state of the machine. The Robot is initialized and then waits for a Navigator to present itself. If a previous Navigator has been killed, the Robot cleans up its own state. The Robot confirms to the FailoverDriver that it has started using the new Navigator . Active : In this state the Robot asks the Navigator for a DrinkOrder , sending it a new Picture of the room. Then the Robot waits for the Navigator to confirm that this request has been recorded. Having received this confirmation the Robot itself informs the FailoverDriver that the handshake with the Navigator is complete and now it is safe to do termination of the Navigator . Think of this as a type of distributed transaction. There is no point terminating the Navigator before the order is stored because it would not be an interesting test. After the Robot receives the requested DrinkOrder it goes to state ExecutingOrder The Navigator The Navigator receives a drink request from the robot, and coordinates that with 2 back end services, a cognitive service that can recognize people in an image, and a route planning service that can figure out how to drive the robot around your house. The Navigator uses a Storage service to persist any state it needs in order to survive the failover test. The Navigator has these states: the Start state Init , Paused , and Active : Init : This is the initial state of the Navigator . After initialization, it pushes the state Paused . Paused : In this state the Navigator is woken up by the FailoverDriver . Then it says \u201cHello\u201d to the Robot and then the Navigator checks for any existing pending request that was already saved in the Storage . If a pending request exists, the Navigator restarts processing this request. Finally, when all this is done, the Navigator goes to state Active . Active : In this state the Navigator receives two types of requests from the Robot : a drink order request and a request for driving instructions. It first saves the request in the Storage and confirms to the Robot that its request has been recorded, then asks the CognitiveService to find a client in the picture of the room, whom the Robot can serve. For DrivingInstructions the Navigator asks the RoutePlannerService to produce a collision-free route from the Robot to the selected client. Finally, when the Navigator receives the requested data from the CognitiveService or the RoutePlannerService it sends the result back to the Robot . The MockStorage MockStorage is a Coyote Actor that models the asynchronous nature of a typical cloud-based storage service. It supports simple read, write, and delete operations where write operations are confirmed with a ConfirmedEvent . This is an Actor model of pseudo-transactional storage. The MockStorage actor receives three kinds of events: a ReadKeyEvent , a KeyValueEvent (requesting the writing of a value under the specified key) and a DeleteKeyEvent . The MockStorage replies with two kinds of events: a KeyValueEvent in response to a ReadKeyEvent and a ConfirmedEvent in response to a (write) KeyValueEvent . This is quite simple processing as you can see when reviewing the code of the sample. Besides the usual functionality, note that the ConfirmedEvent has a boolean Existing member to show if a write operation replaced an existing value under the same key. This can be used by the client of the MockStorage to determine if a key was replaced. For example, the Navigator does actually use this to write a safety Assert checking to make sure a pending drink order request isn\u2019t getting lost in the failover process. The Liveness monitor The LivenessMonitor (See Liveness Checking ) monitors the Robot and the Navigator to make sure the Robot always finishes the job, by serving a Drink . This \u201cliveness\u201d property can be enforced using a very simple LivenessMonitor as shown below: internal class LivenessMonitor : Monitor { public class BusyEvent : Event { } public class IdleEvent : Event { } [Start] [Cold] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(BusyEvent), typeof(Busy))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(IdleEvent))] private class Idle : State { } [Hot] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(IdleEvent), typeof(Idle))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(BusyEvent))] private class Busy : State { } } The Robot can send events to this monitor to tell it when to switch into Busy or Idle state. When the Robot requests a DrinkOrder or DrivingInstructions from the Navigator , it sends this event: this.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.BusyEvent()); And when the Robot finishes an order it sends this event: this.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.IdleEvent()); The Busy state is marked as a [Hot] state and the Idle state is marked as a [Cold] state. During testing if coyote test finds the LivenessMonitor to be stuck in the [Hot] state for too long it raises an exception and the test fails. This is in fact the failure that is detected during the test. Explanation of the bug Remember the last lines of the coyote test execution log file: <ErrorLog> Monitor 'Microsoft.Coyote.Samples.DrinksServingRobot.LivenessMonitor' detected liveness bug in hot state 'Busy' at the end of program execution. If you add to the coyote test command line --graph-bug , and test again: coyote test .\\bin\\net5.0\\DrinksServingRobotActors.dll -i 1000 -ms 2000 --sch-pct 10 --graph-bug you\u2019ll see in the output of the tester that a DGML diagram has been produced: ..... Writing .\\bin\\net5.0\\Output\\DrinksServingRobotActors.exe\\CoyoteOutput\\DrinksServingRobotActors_0_0.dgml Open this with Visual Studio 2019 and you will see a diagram like this. Here the diagram is also animated using the contents of the --xml-trace output so you can see the sequence of events leading up to the bug. MockStateMachineTimer information was removed from this graph just to simplify the diagram: This is the exact snapshot at the time when the bug manifested. This diagram shows that the first Navigator (Navigator(6)) was terminated by the FailoverDriver , which then created a second Navigator (Navigator(13)). The link from this Navigator to the Robot shows that the Navigator registered itself with the Robot . What looks bad is that there is no link from the Robot to this Navigator . The Robot never sent any request and remained waiting. This is in fact the liveness bug! But who sent it in the Active state? The diagram clearly shows that MovingOnRoute was the state from which the transition occurred. The state MovingOnRoute is very simple. It processes a single type of event ( MoveTimerElapsedEvent ) with the NextMove() action: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(MoveTimerElapsedEvent), nameof(NextMove))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(Navigator.DrinkOrderProducedEvent))] internal class MovingOnRoute : State { } private void NextMove() { this.DrinkOrderPending = false; if (this.Route == null) { return; } if (!this.Route.Any()) { this.StopMoving(); this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<ServingClient>(); this.WriteLine(\"<Robot> Reached Client.\"); Specification.Assert( this.Coordinates == this.CurrentOrder.ClientDetails.Coordinates, \"Having reached the Client the Robot's coordinates must be the same as the Client's, but they aren't\"); } else { var nextDestination = this.Route[0]; this.Route.RemoveAt(0); this.MoveTo(nextDestination); this.Timers[\"MoveTimer\"] = this.StartTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(MoveDuration), new MoveTimerElapsedEvent()); } } Note that in this code there is no transition or even mentioning of the state Active \u2026 so how was it possible to transition from MovingOnRoute to Active ? The diagram shows exactly what happened: The Navigator registered itself sending a Navigator.RegisterNavigatorEvent to the Robot . When the Robot dequeued this event, it was in state MovingOnRoute . But this state doesn\u2019t process registrations from the Robot . Then who processed this event? The diagram again answers this. See that the state Init pushed the Active state, and then the following states all happened on the top of the active states stack, with Init below. This was done on purpose so that only one state, Init , should have to deal with the registration of the Navigator . State Init processed the registration of the Navigator , then transitioned to state Active . So what happened was that the robot was in the MoveOnRoute state when Navigator failover occurred. The new Navigator (13) started up and sent the RegisterNavigatorEvent , and the OnSetNavigator sees that this is a failover condition, because this.NavigatorId is already set, so it aborts the current robot move on route operation and goes back to the Active state using this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Active>() But what happened to the Robot in state Active ? Why it didn\u2019t send any request to the Navigator ? This code fragment explains what happened: [OnEntry(nameof(OnInitActive))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(Navigator.DrinkOrderProducedEvent), typeof(ExecutingOrder))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(Navigator.DrinkOrderConfirmedEvent), nameof(OnDrinkOrderConfirmed))] internal class Active : State { } private void OnInitActive() { if (!this.DrinkOrderPending) { this.SendEvent(this.NavigatorId, new Navigator.GetDrinkOrderEvent(this.GetPicture())); this.WriteLine(\"<Robot> Asked for a new Drink Order\"); } this.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.BusyEvent()); } The Robot didn\u2019t send a request to the Navigator , because this.DrinkOrderPending was true (when in fact it should have been false ). The Robot just informed the LivenessMonitor that it is busy, and then waited (forever) to receive the Navigator \u2018s response to the pending order it believed was coming. But it was out of sync with the Navigator because there was no pending order in the Storage service. Thus, the reason for the bug is the incorrect value of this.DrinkOrderPending in state MovingOnRoute at the time of the registration event. Look at the code of Robot.cs where this.DrinkOrderPending is being modified. The only place where this is set to false is in the NextMove() method: private void NextMove() { this.DrinkOrderPending = false; ... } Unfortunately, this is too late\u2026 So when is the right moment to set this.DrinkOrderPending to false ? This is a classic timing bug then, and the coyote tester was able to uncover this bug because it takes control of all the timing and ordering of messages between the actors. The problem is the Navigator considers the drink request complete (and clears the Storage of that request) when it returns the DrivingInstructionsEvent. This event is handled by the robot in the method ReachClient. So this is where the Robot should be clearing its internal DrinkOrderPending state: private void ReachClient(Event e) { var route = (e as DrivingInstructionsEvent)?.Route; if (route != null) { this.Route = route; // this.DrinkOrderPending = false; // this is where it really belongs. this.Timers[\"MoveTimer\"] = this.StartTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(MoveDuration), new MoveTimerElapsedEvent()); } this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<MovingOnRoute>(); } You can even see the fix for the bug in the code above. Although currently commented out, this is the exact place to set DrinkOrderPending to false . So, the fix is to remove from the NextMove() method this line: this.DrinkOrderPending = false; and to move it into the ReachClient() method (or just uncomment the fix that is hidden there). After you perform this fix and rebuild the sample, try running coyote test again with the same command line which previously reported the liveness bug: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/DrinksServingRobotActors.dll -i 1000 -ms 2000 --sch-pct 10 And now no bug will be found \u2013 you should get result similar to this: ..... Iteration #800 ..... Iteration #800 ..... Iteration #900 ..... Iteration #900 ..... Iteration #1000 ..... Iteration #1000 ... Testing statistics: ..... Found 0 bugs. ... Scheduling statistics: ..... Explored 2000 schedules: 0 fair and 2000 unfair. ..... Hit the max-steps bound of '2000' in 8.55% of the unfair schedules. ... Elapsed 25.7423125 sec. . Done If you want to have a high degree of certainty that no bug is found, run the coyote tester with a sufficiently big number of iterations, say 100,000 and --parallel N where N is a number that works well on your computer. If N is too high it will thrash your CPU and the test will run slowly. A good rule of thumb is to use ceiling(0.65 * NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS) . NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS is a system environment variable, typically equal to the number of cores in the computer. But sometimes this number is doubled if your computer supports hyper-threading. Summary Failover testing is simple to achieve using Coyote and yields many interesting bugs in your code, including some thought-provoking design bugs. The technique of halting a \u201cproduction\u201d state-machine, and recreating it by reading from a \u201cpersistent\u201d MockStorage (which is not halted during testing) can be generalized to many other scenarios (such as actual cloud services) where someone needs to test failover logic of production actors using Coyote.

Systems designers usually provide failover capability in servers, systems or networks requiring near-continuous availability and a high degree of reliability.\u201d This sample implements a failover scenario in a system where an instance of a service is terminated and replaced by a new one , unlike the Failover Coffee Machine sample , which is about applying the failover concept to the firmware of an automated espresso machine. In this scenario there is a Robot that must serve drinks to people in a room: Before starting to serve the next client the Robot is always at an InitialLocation in the room. In order to do its job the Robot needs the help of a service called the Navigator , which when provided with the latest picture of the room, finds a person who needs to be served next and sends the details (adult or minor, location) of that person to the Robot . It is not always possible to follow the straight line connecting the Robot \u2018s location with that of the selected client as there are obstacles, like furniture, in the room. Thus, the Robot asks the Navigator to produce a collision-free route from the Robot \u2018s location to the person who will be served. The Navigator provides the requested route that must be reached, with the last being that of the client. A route is simply a list of consecutive straight line segments. The Robot traverses the route and reaches the client. Then the Robot selects randomly an appropriate drink for the client: alcoholic for an adult and non-alcoholic for a minor client. The Robot pours a glass of the selected drink for the client and retreats to its InitialLocation . The steps 1 to 5 above are repeated continuously. To make this a failover test, at random times the Navigator is killed and a new Navigator is created to replace the old one. When this happens it is required that the system will continue to operate flawlessly: no data (request or response) between the Robot and a Navigator will be lost, and the Robot will not stop doing its job. The following diagram depicts the Failover workflow in this sample: Do note: 1. This is a general diagram that can be used not only in this scenario, but for any other scenarios involving a robot that operates with the help of object recognition and route planning. 2. The green nodes represent the product code we are testing here, and everything else is mock test infrastructure. The main goal is to show the use of coyote test in finding concurrency issues even at the design stage when the actual implementation hasn\u2019t started. For this reason we\u2019ve only provided mock implementations of the cognitive service, the route planner, and the storage service. The Navigator doesn\u2019t know these are mock implementations. 3. The sample uses the FailoverDriver component to perform the termination of the Navigator and the creation of a new Navigator . Also a MockStorage component is used to store the state needed to restart the newly-created instance without loss of state. The Robot and the Navigator are modeled as state machines and they are started by another state machine called FailoverDriver . The FailoverDriver lets the first Navigator instance run for a bit then it randomly kills it by sending it the TerminateEvent , then it starts a new Navigator . The new Navigator instance needs to figure out the state of any previous request: was the prior Navigator killed while having an incompletely processed request from the Robot or not? To be able to do so the Navigator stores any newly received request from the Robot in the MockStorage where it remains until the request is completely processed and the response is sent to the Robot and at that moment the Navigator deletes the pending request record from the MockStorage . Note that this is going one step further than the Coffee Machine example. In this example, not only are we testing that the Navigator can restart successfully, but we are also testing that the Robot is also able to handle that failover condition. The following diagram shows the overall plan where Navigator2 is able to complete the request started by Navigator1: The MockStorage is an Actor that provides simple key-value storage for persisting data and its instance lives across all instances of the Navigator . MockStorage makes Navigator failover possible. The MockStorage component, as its name implies, is a mock of a real-world service that provides similar storage capabilities. Likewise, the MockCognitiveService and MockRoutePlanner are mocks of real-world services providing cognitive services (such as object identification) and motion-path planning. Some safety Asserts are placed in the code that verify certain important things, including: - on reaching the client the Robot \u2018s coordinates must be the same as the client\u2019s. - the key retrieved from the MockStorage when requesting a read for a saved Robot \u2018s request is an expected non-null string. - the Navigator checks that after MockStorage performs a write operation to save a Robot \u2018s request this has not overwritten another existing value for the same storage key. This ensures a request from the Robot is not lost. - all required non-null parameters for MockStorage operations (such as key or requestorId ) are indeed non-null. There is a LivenessMonitor that monitors the execution of the system to make sure it never gets stuck, i.e., the Robot always gets a valid response to any of its requests from the Navigator and serves the selected client. See Liveness Checking . A number of excellent bugs were found by coyote test during the development of this sample, and this illustrates the fact that Coyote can be applied to find bugs quickly, even in the design stage, before coding and pushing to production.","title":"Failover robot navigator service with actors"},{"location":"tutorials/failover-robot-navigator-actors/#what-you-will-need","text":"To run the DrinksServingRobotActors example, you will need to: Install Visual Studio 2019 .

You can review the code of the sample to see exactly what the Robot does to serve the client. Init : This is the initial state of the machine. The Robot is initialized and then waits for a Navigator to present itself. If a previous Navigator has been killed, the Robot cleans up its own state. The Robot confirms to the FailoverDriver that it has started using the new Navigator . Active : In this state the Robot asks the Navigator for a DrinkOrder , sending it a new Picture of the room. Then the Robot waits for the Navigator to confirm that this request has been recorded. Having received this confirmation the Robot itself informs the FailoverDriver that the handshake with the Navigator is complete and now it is safe to do termination of the Navigator . Think of this as a type of distributed transaction. There is no point terminating the Navigator before the order is stored because it would not be an interesting test.

The Navigator has these states: the Start state Init , Paused , and Active : Init : This is the initial state of the Navigator . After initialization, it pushes the state Paused . Paused : In this state the Navigator is woken up by the FailoverDriver . Then it says \u201cHello\u201d to the Robot and then the Navigator checks for any existing pending request that was already saved in the Storage . If a pending request exists, the Navigator restarts processing this request. Finally, when all this is done, the Navigator goes to state Active . Active : In this state the Navigator receives two types of requests from the Robot : a drink order request and a request for driving instructions. It first saves the request in the Storage and confirms to the Robot that its request has been recorded, then asks the CognitiveService to find a client in the picture of the room, whom the Robot can serve.

The MockStorage replies with two kinds of events: a KeyValueEvent in response to a ReadKeyEvent and a ConfirmedEvent in response to a (write) KeyValueEvent . This is quite simple processing as you can see when reviewing the code of the sample. Besides the usual functionality, note that the ConfirmedEvent has a boolean Existing member to show if a write operation replaced an existing value under the same key. This can be used by the client of the MockStorage to determine if a key was replaced.

Here the diagram is also animated using the contents of the --xml-trace output so you can see the sequence of events leading up to the bug. MockStateMachineTimer information was removed from this graph just to simplify the diagram: This is the exact snapshot at the time when the bug manifested. This diagram shows that the first Navigator (Navigator(6)) was terminated by the FailoverDriver , which then created a second Navigator (Navigator(13)). The link from this Navigator to the Robot shows that the Navigator registered itself with the Robot . What looks bad is that there is no link from the Robot to this Navigator . The Robot never sent any request and remained waiting. This is in fact the liveness bug! But who sent it in the Active state? The diagram clearly shows that MovingOnRoute was the state from which the transition occurred. The state MovingOnRoute is very simple. It processes a single type of event ( MoveTimerElapsedEvent ) with the NextMove() action: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(MoveTimerElapsedEvent), nameof(NextMove))] [IgnoreEvents(typeof(Navigator.DrinkOrderProducedEvent))] internal class MovingOnRoute : State { } private void NextMove() { this.DrinkOrderPending = false; if (this.Route == null) { return; } if (!this.Route.Any()) { this.StopMoving(); this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<ServingClient>(); this.WriteLine(\"<Robot> Reached Client.\"); Specification.Assert( this.Coordinates == this.CurrentOrder.ClientDetails.Coordinates, \"Having reached the Client the Robot's coordinates must be the same as the Client's, but they aren't\"); } else { var nextDestination = this.Route[0]; this.Route.RemoveAt(0); this.MoveTo(nextDestination); this.Timers[\"MoveTimer\"] = this.StartTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(MoveDuration), new MoveTimerElapsedEvent()); } } Note that in this code there is no transition or even mentioning of the state Active \u2026 so how was it possible to transition from MovingOnRoute to Active ? The diagram shows exactly what happened: The Navigator registered itself sending a Navigator.RegisterNavigatorEvent to the Robot . When the Robot dequeued this event, it was in state MovingOnRoute . But this state doesn\u2019t process registrations from the Robot . Then who processed this event? The diagram again answers this. See that the state Init pushed the Active state, and then the following states all happened on the top of the active states stack, with Init below. This was done on purpose so that only one state, Init , should have to deal with the registration of the Navigator . State Init processed the registration of the Navigator , then transitioned to state Active . So what happened was that the robot was in the MoveOnRoute state when Navigator failover occurred. The new Navigator (13) started up and sent the RegisterNavigatorEvent , and the OnSetNavigator sees that this is a failover condition, because this.NavigatorId is already set, so it aborts the current robot move on route operation and goes back to the Active state using this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<Active>() But what happened to the Robot in state Active ? Why it didn\u2019t send any request to the Navigator ? This code fragment explains what happened: [OnEntry(nameof(OnInitActive))] [OnEventGotoState(typeof(Navigator.DrinkOrderProducedEvent), typeof(ExecutingOrder))] [OnEventDoAction(typeof(Navigator.DrinkOrderConfirmedEvent), nameof(OnDrinkOrderConfirmed))] internal class Active : State { } private void OnInitActive() { if (!this.DrinkOrderPending) { this.SendEvent(this.NavigatorId, new Navigator.GetDrinkOrderEvent(this.GetPicture())); this.WriteLine(\"<Robot> Asked for a new Drink Order\"); } this.Monitor<LivenessMonitor>(new LivenessMonitor.BusyEvent()); } The Robot didn\u2019t send a request to the Navigator , because this.DrinkOrderPending was true (when in fact it should have been false ). The Robot just informed the LivenessMonitor that it is busy, and then waited (forever) to receive the Navigator \u2018s response to the pending order it believed was coming. But it was out of sync with the Navigator because there was no pending order in the Storage service. Thus, the reason for the bug is the incorrect value of this.DrinkOrderPending in state MovingOnRoute at the time of the registration event. Look at the code of Robot.cs where this.DrinkOrderPending is being modified. The only place where this is set to false is in the NextMove() method: private void NextMove() { this.DrinkOrderPending = false; ... } Unfortunately, this is too late\u2026 So when is the right moment to set this.DrinkOrderPending to false ? This is a classic timing bug then, and the coyote tester was able to uncover this bug because it takes control of all the timing and ordering of messages between the actors. The problem is the Navigator considers the drink request complete (and clears the Storage of that request) when it returns the DrivingInstructionsEvent. This event is handled by the robot in the method ReachClient. So this is where the Robot should be clearing its internal DrinkOrderPending state: private void ReachClient(Event e) { var route = (e as DrivingInstructionsEvent)?.Route; if (route != null) { this.Route = route; // this.DrinkOrderPending = false; // this is where it really belongs. this.Timers[\"MoveTimer\"] = this.StartTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(MoveDuration), new MoveTimerElapsedEvent()); } this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<MovingOnRoute>(); } You can even see the fix for the bug in the code above. Although currently commented out, this is the exact place to set DrinkOrderPending to false . So, the fix is to remove from the NextMove() method this line: this.DrinkOrderPending = false; and to move it into the ReachClient() method (or just uncomment the fix that is hidden there). After you perform this fix and rebuild the sample, try running coyote test again with the same command line which previously reported the liveness bug: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/DrinksServingRobotActors.dll -i 1000 -ms 2000 --sch-pct 10 And now no bug will be found \u2013 you should get result similar to this: .....

When using Coyote for testing more complex, real-world systems the time savings can be huge! This will give you the ability to find and fix even the most difficult to reproduce concurrency bugs before pushing to production . To learn more about testing with Coyote read Testing Coyote programs end-to-end and reproducing bugs . The Greeter Please read Programming model: asynchronous actors to gain a basic understanding of the Actors programming model. The core of an Actor based Coyote program, is, well, an Actor class! The following Actor named Greeter is able to receive a RequestGreetingEvent to which it responds with a GreetingEvent : [OnEventDoAction(typeof(RequestGreetingEvent), nameof(HandleGreeting))] public class Greeter : Actor { /// This method is called when this actor receives a RequestGreetingEvent. private void HandleGreeting(Event e) { if (e is RequestGreetingEvent ge) { string greeting = this.RandomBoolean() ? \"Hello World!\" : \"Good Morning\"; this.SendEvent(ge.Caller, new GreetingEvent(greeting)); if (this.RandomBoolean(10)) { // bug: a 1 in 10 chance of sending too many greetings. this.SendEvent(ge.Caller, new GreetingEvent(greeting)); } } } } Notice the OnEventDoAction custom attribute decorating the class. This tells the Coyote runtime that this class expects to receive RequestGreetingEvents . These events will be queued in the inbox for this Actor until the right time to dequeue them and process them. The custom attribute tells the Coyote runtime to call the HandleGreeting method. The Coyote runtime will also report an error if a different type of event is sent to the Greeter . The HandleGreeting method is called with an Event parameter, and you know in this case the event will be of type RequestGreetingEvent . This event is defined in Events.cs like this: internal class RequestGreetingEvent : Event { public readonly ActorId Caller; public RequestGreetingEvent(ActorId caller) { this.Caller = caller; } } The inbox is crucial to the Actor model You can think of an Event declaration as a type of interface definition for Actors . Events really define the interface of an Actor because the caller will never get to see the Greeter class, so the caller can\u2019t just call HandleGreeting directly. The caller only gets to see an ActorId , which is like a Coyote runtime handle to the actor. There is a really important reason for this . Events are queued in an inbox managed by the Actor base class. This serializes the incoming events so that at any given time, only one event is being handled in the Greeter . This greatly simplifies concurrent programming. For example, there is no need to use lock to protect against data race conditions, and therefore no need to worry about deadlocks. Each Actor instance can run in a separate thread, so all actors in the system can be hugely parallel, but at the same time the processing inside an Actor is incredibly simple. So you get the best of both worlds, code that scales but is also easy to write. An Actor receives messages, and can create other Actor objects, and can send events. Notice the Greeter gets an ActorId from the RequestGreetingEvent and uses that to send a greeting back to the caller using SendEvent : this.SendEvent(ge.Caller, new GreetingEvent(greeting)); You can also see the bug which has been injected deliberately, namely, it randomly returns more than one GreetingEvent . A TestActor To test this Greeter you will need to setup a TestActor which is done in Program.cs . The TestActor creates the Greeter and sends between 1 and 5 RequestGreetingEvents . The TestActor is declared in a way that tells the Coyote runtime it is expecting to receive GreetingEvents as follows: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(GreetingEvent), nameof(HandleGreeting))] ``` To make this a good test, the `TestActor` keeps track of how many greetings were sent and how many were received, and it writes an `Assert` to ensure it doesn't receive too many as follows: ```c# private void HandleGreeting(Event e) { // this is perfectly thread safe, because all message handling in actors is // serialized within the Actor class. this.Count--; string greeting = ((GreetingEvent)e).Greeting; Console.WriteLine(\"Received greeting: {0}\", greeting); this.Assert(this.Count >= 0, \"Too many greetings returned!\"); } Lastly, to test the TestActor you need to fire up the Coyote runtime which is done in the HostProgram Main entry point as follows: public static void Main() { var config = Configuration.Create(); IActorRuntime runtime = RuntimeFactory.Create(config); Execute(runtime); runtime.OnFailure += OnRuntimeFailure; Console.WriteLine(\"press ENTER to terminate...\"); Console.ReadLine(); } Notice that Coyote actors run in parallel, so you have to stop the program from terminating prematurely, which can be done with a Console.ReadLine call. In order for this program to also be testable using the coyote test tool, you need to declare a test method as follows: [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { runtime.CreateActor(typeof(TestActor)); } The coyote test tool will call this method. But it will not call your Main entry point. So this Execute method needs to be standalone. It cannot depend on anything except statically initialized variables. There is no way to get command line arguments from coyote test through to this method. This Execute method is very simple, it just creates the TestActor . In Coyote once an actor is created it lives forever until it is halted.

The core of an Actor based Coyote program, is, well, an Actor class! The following Actor named Greeter is able to receive a RequestGreetingEvent to which it responds with a GreetingEvent : [OnEventDoAction(typeof(RequestGreetingEvent), nameof(HandleGreeting))] public class Greeter : Actor { /// This method is called when this actor receives a RequestGreetingEvent. private void HandleGreeting(Event e) { if (e is RequestGreetingEvent ge) { string greeting = this.RandomBoolean() ? \"Hello World!\" : \"Good Morning\"; this.SendEvent(ge.Caller, new GreetingEvent(greeting)); if (this.RandomBoolean(10)) { // bug: a 1 in 10 chance of sending too many greetings. this.SendEvent(ge.Caller, new GreetingEvent(greeting)); } } } } Notice the OnEventDoAction custom attribute decorating the class. This tells the Coyote runtime that this class expects to receive RequestGreetingEvents . These events will be queued in the inbox for this Actor until the right time to dequeue them and process them. The custom attribute tells the Coyote runtime to call the HandleGreeting method. The Coyote runtime will also report an error if a different type of event is sent to the Greeter . The HandleGreeting method is called with an Event parameter, and you know in this case the event will be of type RequestGreetingEvent . This event is defined in Events.cs like this: internal class RequestGreetingEvent : Event { public readonly ActorId Caller; public RequestGreetingEvent(ActorId caller) { this.Caller = caller; } }","title":"The Greeter"},{"location":"tutorials/hello-world-actors/#the-inbox-is-crucial-to-the-actor-model","text":"You can think of an Event declaration as a type of interface definition for Actors . Events really define the interface of an Actor because the caller will never get to see the Greeter class, so the caller can\u2019t just call HandleGreeting directly. The caller only gets to see an ActorId , which is like a Coyote runtime handle to the actor. There is a really important reason for this . Events are queued in an inbox managed by the Actor base class. This serializes the incoming events so that at any given time, only one event is being handled in the Greeter . This greatly simplifies concurrent programming. For example, there is no need to use lock to protect against data race conditions, and therefore no need to worry about deadlocks. Each Actor instance can run in a separate thread, so all actors in the system can be hugely parallel, but at the same time the processing inside an Actor is incredibly simple. So you get the best of both worlds, code that scales but is also easy to write. An Actor receives messages, and can create other Actor objects, and can send events. Notice the Greeter gets an ActorId from the RequestGreetingEvent and uses that to send a greeting back to the caller using SendEvent : this.SendEvent(ge.Caller, new GreetingEvent(greeting)); You can also see the bug which has been injected deliberately, namely, it randomly returns more than one GreetingEvent .","title":"The inbox is crucial to the Actor model"},{"location":"tutorials/hello-world-actors/#a-testactor","text":"To test this Greeter you will need to setup a TestActor which is done in Program.cs . The TestActor creates the Greeter and sends between 1 and 5 RequestGreetingEvents . The TestActor is declared in a way that tells the Coyote runtime it is expecting to receive GreetingEvents as follows: [OnEventDoAction(typeof(GreetingEvent), nameof(HandleGreeting))] ``` To make this a good test, the `TestActor` keeps track of how many greetings were sent and how many were received, and it writes an `Assert` to ensure it doesn't receive too many as follows: ```c# private void HandleGreeting(Event e) { // this is perfectly thread safe, because all message handling in actors is // serialized within the Actor class. this.Count--; string greeting = ((GreetingEvent)e).Greeting; Console.WriteLine(\"Received greeting: {0}\", greeting); this.Assert(this.Count >= 0, \"Too many greetings returned!\"); } Lastly, to test the TestActor you need to fire up the Coyote runtime which is done in the HostProgram Main entry point as follows: public static void Main() { var config = Configuration.Create(); IActorRuntime runtime = RuntimeFactory.Create(config); Execute(runtime); runtime.OnFailure += OnRuntimeFailure; Console.WriteLine(\"press ENTER to terminate...\"); Console.ReadLine(); } Notice that Coyote actors run in parallel, so you have to stop the program from terminating prematurely, which can be done with a Console.ReadLine call. In order for this program to also be testable using the coyote test tool, you need to declare a test method as follows: [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { runtime.CreateActor(typeof(TestActor)); } The coyote test tool will call this method. But it will not call your Main entry point. So this Execute method needs to be standalone. It cannot depend on anything except statically initialized variables. There is no way to get command line arguments from coyote test through to this method. This Execute method is very simple, it just creates the TestActor . In Coyote once an actor is created it lives forever until it is halted. Note that Coyote programs can run forever, the coyote test tool has ways of interrupting and restarting this Execute method based on --iterations and --max-steps arguments provided to the test tool.

So, even in this simple case Coyote finds the bug tens or even hundreds of times quicker. When using Coyote for testing much more complex, real-world systems the time savings can be even more impressive! This will give you the ability to find and fix even the most difficult to reproduce concurrency bugs before pushing to production . To learn more about testing with Coyote read Testing Coyote programs end-to-end and reproducing bugs . The code This section shows how to write a program using the Coyote asynchronous task programming model . The Coyote controlled Task type is a drop-in replacement for the System.Threading.Tasks.Task type, and thus any prior experience writing asynchronous code using async and await is useful and relevant. If you are not already familiar with async and await , you can learn more in the C# docs . The program consists of two code files: 1. Program.cs contains the Main() entry point of the application. 2. Greeter.cs defines the Greeter class. Its RunAsync() method is where \u201call the work\u201d is done. Here is the code for Greeter.cs : using System; using Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications; using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; namespace Microsoft.Coyote.Samples.HelloWorldTasks { internal class Greeter { private const string HelloWorld = \"Hello World!\"; private const string GoodMorning = \"Good Morning\"; private string Value; private async Task WriteWithDelayAsync(string value) { await Task.Delay(100); this.Value = value; } public async Task RunAsync() { Task task1 = this.WriteWithDelayAsync(GoodMorning); Task task2 = this.WriteWithDelayAsync(HelloWorld); Task task3 = this.WriteWithDelayAsync(HelloWorld); Task task4 = this.WriteWithDelayAsync(HelloWorld); Task task5 = this.WriteWithDelayAsync(HelloWorld); await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2, task3, task4, task5); Console.WriteLine(this.Value); Specification.Assert(this.Value == HelloWorld, $\"Value is '{this.Value}' instead of '{HelloWorld}'.\"); } } } WriteWithDelayAsync() is a C# async method that asynchronously waits for a 100ms delay (created via the Task.Delay(100) call), and then modifies the value of the private string Value . The RunAsync() asynchronous method is invoking the WriteWithDelayAsync() method five times, first passing the value \"Good Morning\" and the value \"Hello World!\" for the others. Each method call returns a Task object, which can be awaited upon using await . After invoking these asynchronous method calls The RunAsync method calls Task.WhenAll(...) to await on the completion of all the async tasks. Because the WriteWithDelayAsync() method awaits a Task.Delay to complete, it will yield control to the caller of the method, which is the RunAsync() method. However, the RunAsync() method is not doing any awaiting immediately after invoking the WriteWithDelayAsync() method calls. This means that the five calls will be executed in parallel , and thus depending entirely on the thread scheduling the Value member will be set to either \"Good Morning\" or \"Hello World!\" after Task.WhenAll(...) completes. Using Specification.Assert , Coyote allows you to write assertions that check these kinds of safety properties. In this case, the assertion will check if the value is \"Hello World!\" or not, and if not, it will throw an exception, or during testing will report an error together with a reproducible trace. Definitely, this Assert will fire sometimes because the asynchronous tasks do not have a guaranteed order. Despite having this assertion here on purpose, imagine if in a real project the programmer who wrote the Assert didn\u2019t realize how asynchronous the code was, or perhaps the programmer who wrote the code didn\u2019t read and understand the Assert properly and has violated the specification in their overly asynchronous implementation. Either way this is a demonstration showing that assertions like this can be very useful in finding some pretty tricky bugs. The code for Program.cs is much simpler: using Microsoft.Coyote.Runtime; using Microsoft.Coyote.Samples.HelloWorld; using Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks; namespace Microsoft.Coyote.Samples.HelloWorldTasks { public static class Program { public static async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Main() { await Execute(); } [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] public static async Task Execute() { var greeter = new Greeter(); await greeter.RunAsync(); } } } The static async Task Main() method is the entry point to the program, as usual for a .NET executable. If you didn\u2019t want the program to be testable with coyote test , you could omit the second method above, and simply write Main() as: public static async Task Main() { var greeter = new Greeter(); await greeter.RunAsync(); } However, here the intent is that the code must be testable with coyote test . This is done by including the Execute() method and the only thing the Main() method does is to call this async Execute() method and await its execution. It is a rule in Coyote that for any executable to be testable with coyote test , it must contain a static Execute() method which must have a specific, signature. In this code one of these allowed signatures for the method is specified. Do note the [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test] attribute of the Execute() method, and its return type: Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks.Task . When these are specified, then coyote test can find the Execute() method in the executable assembly and can control its execution. The Coyote Task type uses a C# 7 feature known as async task types (see here ) that allows framework developers to create custom task types that can be used with async and await . This is where the magic happens. In production, Task enables C# to build a custom asynchronous state machine that uses regular Task objects. However, during testing, Coyote uses dependency injection to supply another custom implementation of an asynchronous state machine that allows controlling the scheduling of Task objects, and thus systematically explore their interleavings. Also note that with coyote test the Main() method is not executed! This is why it is recommended that the Main() method should not contain any other code except awaiting the Execute() method. If it does contain other actions, those actions would not be executed by coyote test . If you need to pass information from Main to Execute you can use a static variable with a default value. This way the Execute will run with the default value during coyote test .

The ClusterManager is an abstract state machine that models the concept of being able to broadcast messages to all Servers registered in a cluster. Sending an event to this cluster will result in all Servers getting that same event. So, as the raft protocol requires, broadcasting VoteRequestEvents can be done by a Server using this SendEvent instruction: this.SendEvent(this.ClusterManager, new VoteRequestEvent(this.CurrentTerm, this.Manager.ServerId, lastLogIndex, lastLogTerm)); You will see similar calls sending VoteResponseEvent , AppendLogEntriesRequestEvent , AppendLogEntriesResponseEvent , and ClientResponseEvent via the ClusterManager . The second project builds Raft.Azure.dll and contains all the Azure specific code that hooks all this up to an Azure Service Bus . Notice it implements the IServerManager interface in a class named AzureServer and it subclasses the ClusterManager in a state machine named AzureClusterManager . This subclass achieves the required broadcast semantics by forwarding all events received to an Azure Service Bus pub/sub topic. It also has an AzureMessageReceiver class which subscribes to the Azure service bus topic, and forwards those events back into the local Coyote state machine using SendEvent . You can think of AzureClusterManager and AzureMessageReceiver as an example of how to \u201cbridge\u201d an external messaging platform with the Coyote runtime. In this way you can map Coyote Actors to any underlying messaging platform which is why Coyote does not force you to use any particular message platform. Initialization When you run the Raft.Azure.dll command line you will see some options: Option Description --connection-string your Azure Service Bus connection string --topic-name optional string for Service Bus Topic (default \u2018rafttopic\u2019) --num-servers number of servers to spawn As you can see here Raft.Azure.dll will launch each server in a separate process. The first process is the Client process, then each subsequent one is a Server instance according to the specified --local-cluster-size command line argument. The following diagram shows what this looks like when we have 2 servers in the cluster: The startup sequence for all this can be found in Program.cs and goes like this: Parse the command line for the client process and call RunAsync . RunAsync sets up the Azure Service Bus pub/sub topic using CreateTopicAsync , and creates a subscription to that topic using CreateSubscriptionAsync . Each process does this same thing so they can all talk to each other via the Azure Service Bus using the TopicClient . Create the Coyote IActorRuntime using RuntimeFactory.Create . The TopicClient is then wrapped by the first Coyote Actor called AzureClusterManager . Then depending which process is running it calls RunClient or RunServer . RunClient launches the server processes in StartRaftServers and special hidden command line arguments --server-id and --client-process-id tell those child processes to run in server mode. RunClient creates an AzureMessageReceiver , and sends a sequence of ClientRequestEvents , waiting for a response from the cluster for each request. RunServer creates the AzureServer object and an AzureMessageReceiver , telling the AzureMessageReceiver to run forever asynchronously. Each server terminates when the client terminates which is done by MonitorClientProcess . The AzureServer object creates a StateMachine of type Server . Note: MonitorClientProcess doesn\u2019t work when you run the project from Visual Studio debugger, in that case you may have to kill the spawned dotnet processes by hand. Processing The Server state machine is where the interesting code lives, it is a complete implementation of the Raft protocol. All the Server instances form a fault-tolerant server cluster, that can handle ClientRequestEvents in a reliable way. Server instances can failover, and the cluster protocol is able to figure out which server should handle which client request, and how to replicate the logs across all servers for safe keeping and reliability. The whole idea is that with this cluster there is no single point of failure. Clearly for this to be reliable, it must also be bug free, and therefore is an excellent candidate for thorough testing by the coyote test tool. The RunClient method shows how you can use the cluster , namely, sending a ClientRequestEvent and waiting for the async response that comes back from the service bus in the ClientResponseEvent . Sending a message to the cluster is done like this: runtime.SendEvent(clusterManager, new ClientRequestEvent(command)); Receiving a response is done using the ResponseReceived event on the AzureMessageReceiver . The client then uses a TaskCompletionSource to synchronize these two events so that it waits for a ClientResponseEvent before sending the next ClientRequestEvent . Each ClientRequestEvent goes to all server processes in the cluster via the Azure Service Bus. The servers then implement their Raft voting protocol to figure out which server will handle the request. The sample runs each Server on the same machine, just for simplicity, but in a real fault-tolerant system you would probably want to run each server on a different VM in the cloud and get a real distributed cluster going. You could use Kubernetes or some other system to manage that setup. The Azure Service Bus code would be the same in either case. The AzureServer code is a bit more complicated than you might expect, where it uses CreateActorIdFromName , then a Initialize method to create the Server state machines and a Start that sends a NotifyJoinedServiceEvent to kick things off. The reason for all this will become more apparent when you look at the mocked implementation . In the mocking case all Server state machines run in the same process and in that case the servers must not start until all server instances have been created. This is an example of how the issue of testability can sometimes affect how you do things in your production code. CreateActorIdFromName creates only the ActorId object and does not actually create the actor. This is handy when you need to give that ActorId to another Actor as part of an initialization process. Then at a later time when everything is ready we can create the actual actor using this predetermined id as follows: this.Runtime.CreateActor(id, typeof(Server), new Server.SetupServerEvent(this, this.ClusterManager)); Notice the Server when it is in the start state ( Init ), it defers all events using a special wild card: [DeferEvents(typeof(WildCardEvent))] Then only when NotifyJoinedServiceEvent arrives does it go to the Follower state where the raft protocol begins and any queued messages can be processed. This tutorial does not go into the gory details of the entire Server protocol implementation, but there is a great animation of how the Raft Protocol works on this website . Please check that out, as it will make the Server code easier to understand. This more detailed walkthrough of the protocol can also help make things even more clear. The overall Server state machine flow looks like this: In a nutshell, each Server instance can be in one of three states, Follower , Candidate or Leader . Each Server starts in the Follower state. If these followers don\u2019t hear from a leader in a small timeout period then they promote themselves to Candidate state where each candidate requests a vote from the other servers in the cluster using the VoteRequestEvent . The other servers figure out how to reply to those votes, either accepting or denying the request sending back a corresponding VoteResponseEvent . A Candidate then becomes a Leader if it gets affirmative votes from a majority of the Server nodes in the cluster. A Leader then appends a new entry to the distributed log by sending an AppendLogEntriesRequestEvent to the other servers in the cluster. A AppendLogEntriesResponseEvent is returned in response to that which includes a success indicator. Now there are more details to this, like what happens if two servers get a majority vote or if a AppendLogEntriesRequestEvent fails for some reason. The cluster does some clever book keeping using a type of version number called \u201cTerm\u201d where in some cases an elected Leader can be rolled back to Follower enabling a new election process to continue and so on. Note: a real application of this protocol could be deployed where you simply add new [DataMember] fields to each ClientRequestEvent . These serializable members will be automatically replicated across the Servers and you implement whatever server logic you need at the point in the Server state machine where new log entries are about to be committed, if the server logic succeeds the Coyote commit continues, otherwise it is rolled back. Summary In this tutorial you learned: How to hook Coyote Actors and StateMachines up to a real production ready messaging platform (like Azure Service Bus).

This is a great way to build a reliable application or service. But there is overhead in using an enterprise scale service bus, which limits our ability to fully test the state machine. Clearly a fault-tolerant server consensus protocol needs to be thoroughly tested, which is what you will do in this tutorial. First you will mock the Azure Service Bus which allows the Coyote tester to perform thousands of tests per second and thereby find bugs in the application code more efficiently. Then you will use the coyote test tool to explore the code using different test strategies until you achieve a high level of confidence that the code is rock solid. What you will need You will also need to: Install Visual Studio 2019 . Install the .NET Core 3.1 version of the coyote tool . Clone the Coyote Samples git repo . Be familiar with the coyote test tool. See Testing . Build the samples Build the coyote-samples repo by running the following command: powershell -f build.ps1 Run the Raft.Mocking application Now you can run coyote test tool on the Raft.Mocking application: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/Raft.Mocking.dll -i 1000 -ms 200 --coverage activity You should see the test succeed with output like this, including a coverage report and graph: .

Done Now you are seeing a longer more realistic test run. But if you create a --verbose log you will see that in these 61 seconds the test actually tested over 2.4 million async operations!! In this case you should see Total event coverage: 100.0% which is a great sign, this means every possible event has been sent and received by every state of every state machine that you tested here. This is not the same thing as 100% code coverage, but it is a higher level of abstraction on coverage. Both are important. The coverage report has a separate section for each Actor or StateMachine that was covered by the test. It then lists the overall event coverage as a percentage, then lists the details of each State . For actors there will be only one state listed, matching the name of the Actor type. For example, the Server section reports the Candidate state like this: State: Candidate State event coverage: 100.0% Events received: Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.Timers.TimerElapsedEvent, AppendLogEntriesRequestEvent, AppendLogEntriesResponseEvent, VoteRequestEvent, VoteResponseEvent Events sent: AppendLogEntriesResponseEvent, VoteRequestEvent, VoteResponseEvent Previous states: Candidate, Follower Next states: Candidate, Follower, Leader This shows 100% coverage for the state, meaning all expected events have been received, it lists those under Events received , and it also lists all Events sent while in this state. Lastly it shows all recorded state transitions in and out of this state. Previous states are the states that transitions to the Candidate state and Next states are the states that the Candidate state went to using RaiseGotoStateEVent transitions. The key thing to look for here is that during this test run some of the Server state machines did make it to the Leader state. Notice because of the mocking of Azure API\u2019s this application is now able to run 200 steps per iteration and a thousand iterations pretty quickly, much faster than if all those messages were going to Azure and back. This means the test can quickly explore every kind of asynchronous timing of events to find all the bugs. Not only is it faster but it is also systematic in how it explores every possible interleaving of asynchronous operations. This systematic approach ensures the test doesn\u2019t just test the same happy paths over and over (like a stress test does) but instead it is more likely to find one bad path where a bug is hiding. The --coverage report also generates a DGML diagram of all the messages sent during the test. You can browse these graphs using Visual Studio. The file name in this case is Raft.Mocking.dgml and it will look something like this: Here you see all the Actor objects in green, and Monitor in blue and StateMachine and ExternalCode objects in gray. You can see that all the states were explored in the Server , including the Leader state. The MockStateMachineTimer is a helper Actor provided as a mock implementation CreateTimer and CreatePeriodicTimer API\u2019s. There are many different coyote test command line options you can play with to test different things and really increase your confidence level in the code you are testing. For example there are 4 different test scheduling options you can play with: Option Description --sch-random Choose the random scheduling strategy (this is the default) --sch-pct uint Choose the PCT scheduling strategy with given maximum number of priority switch points --sch-fairpct uint Choose the fair PCT scheduling strategy with given maximum number of priority switch points --sch-portfolio Choose the portfolio scheduling strategy in combination with parallel testing These options change how coyote test explores the large state space of possible schedules for your async operations. The last option is interesting because it allows you to test many different scheduling strategies at once, this is used in combination with the --parallel test option, so the following, for example, would run 5 parallel test processes using different scheduling strategies: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/Raft.Mocking.dll -i 1000 -ms 200 --coverage activity --sch-portfolio --parallel 5 When you use this the test will print the chosen strategies at the top of the test output: ... Task 3 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:3922897588). ... Task 4 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:3469760925). ... Task 2 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:1642014516). ... Task 1 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:1466235705). ... Task 0 is using 'Random' strategy (seed:3931672516). You can also increase the number of iterations to 10,000,000 if you want to, then come back tomorrow and see how it did. Clearly, you should now see that Coyote makes it possible to thoroughly test your code automatically, without you having to write a million individual boring unit tests that test every little possibility in terms of sending and receiving messages. Manual unit testing has a place in software engineering, but what Coyote does is more powerful. With Coyote you can explore a very large number of combinations and find lots of bugs which greatly increases confidence in your code. One interesting thing about Coyote is that every time you run a test you might explore a slightly different space and so continuous integration testing where you run tests on every checkin, or longer test suites every night, has a higher chance of finding that one ridiculously embarrassing bug before you go live with your service. You might wonder, if there is randomness in the testing, how will you reproduce bugs that are found? The answer lies in the random seed printed above (seed:3469760925) . This is all you need to re-run an identical test, so interesting random seeds can also become your regression test suite. Imagine, an entire interesting regression test is simply one integer. There is one restriction to this, if the product code you are testing changes the set of non-deterministic choices, then prior saved random seeds are no longer usable, but you can quickly build a new set by simply running more tests. Comparing this with the cost of maintaining large static regression test suite code bases, this is quite an improvement. Instead of building lots of little manual unit tests, you will find that when using Coyote your time is better spent designing interesting mocks that accurately model all the kinds of weird things that can happen when interacting with external systems. You also should write lots of interesting specifications throughout these mocks that use Assert to ensure everything is running properly during the test. You also should use the Monitor pattern to ensure all the global invariants you care about in your system remain true no matter what a specific test run is doing. Design The following diagram illustrates how the MockClient actor sends ClientRequestEvents , and how the MockClusterManager subclasses from ClusterManager . There is also a MockServerHost that implements the IServerManager interface and a RaftTestScenario class which sets everything up. Notice that the Server code you are testing here is the exact same production ready code you used in the Raft actor service (on Azure) tutorial. You should now see that this is very cool . You have switched the Server from running on Azure to running locally with a bunch of mocks and didn\u2019t have to change one line of Server code. For this test we also inject a SafetyMonitor into the process by simply registering it on the runtime like this: runtime.RegisterMonitor<SafetyMonitor>(); This enables the monitor so that when the MockServerHost sends the NotifyLeaderElected it can keep track and make sure there is only one leader per term. The MockClusterManager implementation is very simple, since at test time all Server instances are in the same process, a broadcast operation is simply a for-loop over those servers, sending the broadcast event to each one using SendEvent . The MockServerHost is a bit tricky, since all the Server actors have to be created before you start them using the NotifyJoinedServiceEvent otherwise the MockClusterManager might be too quick and start sending events to a Server instance before it is ready. Now you can see why the IServerManager interface was designed this way in the original Raft.Azure example. The RaftTestScenario then creates all the actors needed to run the test including all the mock actors and the real Server instances. This is all relatively simple compared to the original Raft.Azure example that was also dealing with setting up the Azure Service Bus. This mock test setup is able to fully test the Server implementation and get good coverage. The IServerManager interface and the abstract ClusterManager state machine where originally designed with testability in mind and that\u2019s what makes this easy mocking of the external pieces possible. The test also includes a coyote Monitor called SafetyMonitor which provides a global invariant check, namely checking there is never more than one Server that is elected to be the Leader at the same time. The Monitor class in Coyote shows how to inject additional work that you want to do at test time only, and have almost no overhead in the production code. Hopefully you agree it is pretty easy to create a monitor and that monitoring like this is a powerful concept that adds a lot of value to your Coyote testing process. Summary In this tutorial you learned: How to mock external systems like Azure Service Bus to make a Coyote test run fast. How to use the coyote test command line to explore different test strategies. How to read a Coyote coverage report and view the coverage graph. How to inject test logic like the SafetyMonitor in to the coyote test scenario that monitors the overall correctness of your system in a way that has minimal overhead in your production code. How to think about model based testing using random seeds and integrate that into your continuous integration testing process. You can also explore the Raft.Nondeterminism.dll version of this sample that injects a bug in the system by randomly sending duplicate VoteRequestEvents . Then you can see how the coyote test tool is able to spot the resulting bugs because of the SafetyMonitor .","title":"Raft actor service (mocked)"},{"location":"tutorials/raft-mocking/#raft-consensus-protocol-with-mocks-for-testing","text":"In the previous example you created an Azure application that uses Coyote and performs messaging using Azure Service Bus .

Done Now you are seeing a longer more realistic test run. But if you create a --verbose log you will see that in these 61 seconds the test actually tested over 2.4 million async operations!! In this case you should see Total event coverage: 100.0% which is a great sign, this means every possible event has been sent and received by every state of every state machine that you tested here. This is not the same thing as 100% code coverage, but it is a higher level of abstraction on coverage. Both are important. The coverage report has a separate section for each Actor or StateMachine that was covered by the test. It then lists the overall event coverage as a percentage, then lists the details of each State . For actors there will be only one state listed, matching the name of the Actor type. For example, the Server section reports the Candidate state like this: State: Candidate State event coverage: 100.0% Events received: Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.Timers.TimerElapsedEvent, AppendLogEntriesRequestEvent, AppendLogEntriesResponseEvent, VoteRequestEvent, VoteResponseEvent Events sent: AppendLogEntriesResponseEvent, VoteRequestEvent, VoteResponseEvent Previous states: Candidate, Follower Next states: Candidate, Follower, Leader This shows 100% coverage for the state, meaning all expected events have been received, it lists those under Events received , and it also lists all Events sent while in this state. Lastly it shows all recorded state transitions in and out of this state. Previous states are the states that transitions to the Candidate state and Next states are the states that the Candidate state went to using RaiseGotoStateEVent transitions. The key thing to look for here is that during this test run some of the Server state machines did make it to the Leader state. Notice because of the mocking of Azure API\u2019s this application is now able to run 200 steps per iteration and a thousand iterations pretty quickly, much faster than if all those messages were going to Azure and back. This means the test can quickly explore every kind of asynchronous timing of events to find all the bugs. Not only is it faster but it is also systematic in how it explores every possible interleaving of asynchronous operations. This systematic approach ensures the test doesn\u2019t just test the same happy paths over and over (like a stress test does) but instead it is more likely to find one bad path where a bug is hiding. The --coverage report also generates a DGML diagram of all the messages sent during the test. You can browse these graphs using Visual Studio. The file name in this case is Raft.Mocking.dgml and it will look something like this: Here you see all the Actor objects in green, and Monitor in blue and StateMachine and ExternalCode objects in gray. You can see that all the states were explored in the Server , including the Leader state. The MockStateMachineTimer is a helper Actor provided as a mock implementation CreateTimer and CreatePeriodicTimer API\u2019s. There are many different coyote test command line options you can play with to test different things and really increase your confidence level in the code you are testing. For example there are 4 different test scheduling options you can play with: Option Description --sch-random Choose the random scheduling strategy (this is the default) --sch-pct uint Choose the PCT scheduling strategy with given maximum number of priority switch points --sch-fairpct uint Choose the fair PCT scheduling strategy with given maximum number of priority switch points --sch-portfolio Choose the portfolio scheduling strategy in combination with parallel testing These options change how coyote test explores the large state space of possible schedules for your async operations. The last option is interesting because it allows you to test many different scheduling strategies at once, this is used in combination with the --parallel test option, so the following, for example, would run 5 parallel test processes using different scheduling strategies: coyote test ./bin/net5.0/Raft.Mocking.dll -i 1000 -ms 200 --coverage activity --sch-portfolio --parallel 5 When you use this the test will print the chosen strategies at the top of the test output: ... Task 3 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:3922897588). ... Task 4 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:3469760925). ... Task 2 is using 'ProbabilisticRandom' strategy (seed:1642014516). ... Task 1 is using 'FairPCT' strategy (seed:1466235705). ... Task 0 is using 'Random' strategy (seed:3931672516). You can also increase the number of iterations to 10,000,000 if you want to, then come back tomorrow and see how it did. Clearly, you should now see that Coyote makes it possible to thoroughly test your code automatically, without you having to write a million individual boring unit tests that test every little possibility in terms of sending and receiving messages. Manual unit testing has a place in software engineering, but what Coyote does is more powerful. With Coyote you can explore a very large number of combinations and find lots of bugs which greatly increases confidence in your code. One interesting thing about Coyote is that every time you run a test you might explore a slightly different space and so continuous integration testing where you run tests on every checkin, or longer test suites every night, has a higher chance of finding that one ridiculously embarrassing bug before you go live with your service. You might wonder, if there is randomness in the testing, how will you reproduce bugs that are found? The answer lies in the random seed printed above (seed:3469760925) . This is all you need to re-run an identical test, so interesting random seeds can also become your regression test suite. Imagine, an entire interesting regression test is simply one integer. There is one restriction to this, if the product code you are testing changes the set of non-deterministic choices, then prior saved random seeds are no longer usable, but you can quickly build a new set by simply running more tests. Comparing this with the cost of maintaining large static regression test suite code bases, this is quite an improvement. Instead of building lots of little manual unit tests, you will find that when using Coyote your time is better spent designing interesting mocks that accurately model all the kinds of weird things that can happen when interacting with external systems. You also should write lots of interesting specifications throughout these mocks that use Assert to ensure everything is running properly during the test. You also should use the Monitor pattern to ensure all the global invariants you care about in your system remain true no matter what a specific test run is doing.","title":"Run the Raft.Mocking application"},{"location":"tutorials/raft-mocking/#design","text":"The following diagram illustrates how the MockClient actor sends ClientRequestEvents , and how the MockClusterManager subclasses from ClusterManager . There is also a MockServerHost that implements the IServerManager interface and a RaftTestScenario class which sets everything up. Notice that the Server code you are testing here is the exact same production ready code you used in the Raft actor service (on Azure) tutorial. You should now see that this is very cool . You have switched the Server from running on Azure to running locally with a bunch of mocks and didn\u2019t have to change one line of Server code. For this test we also inject a SafetyMonitor into the process by simply registering it on the runtime like this: runtime.RegisterMonitor<SafetyMonitor>(); This enables the monitor so that when the MockServerHost sends the NotifyLeaderElected it can keep track and make sure there is only one leader per term. The MockClusterManager implementation is very simple, since at test time all Server instances are in the same process, a broadcast operation is simply a for-loop over those servers, sending the broadcast event to each one using SendEvent . The MockServerHost is a bit tricky, since all the Server actors have to be created before you start them using the NotifyJoinedServiceEvent otherwise the MockClusterManager might be too quick and start sending events to a Server instance before it is ready. Now you can see why the IServerManager interface was designed this way in the original Raft.Azure example. The RaftTestScenario then creates all the actors needed to run the test including all the mock actors and the real Server instances. This is all relatively simple compared to the original Raft.Azure example that was also dealing with setting up the Azure Service Bus. This mock test setup is able to fully test the Server implementation and get good coverage. The IServerManager interface and the abstract ClusterManager state machine where originally designed with testability in mind and that\u2019s what makes this easy mocking of the external pieces possible. The test also includes a coyote Monitor called SafetyMonitor which provides a global invariant check, namely checking there is never more than one Server that is elected to be the Leader at the same time. The Monitor class in Coyote shows how to inject additional work that you want to do at test time only, and have almost no overhead in the production code. Hopefully you agree it is pretty easy to create a monitor and that monitoring like this is a powerful concept that adds a lot of value to your Coyote testing process.","title":"Design"},{"location":"tutorials/raft-mocking/#summary","text":"In this tutorial you learned: How to mock external systems like Azure Service Bus to make a Coyote test run fast.
